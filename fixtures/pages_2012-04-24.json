I'm currently working as a graduate assistant in the Honors College at Kent where I am an academic advisor for 72 Honors College freshmen.<br /><br />I would also like to mention that we have lots of events for Honors and I get to meet the rapper, Common, in February when he comes for a lecture series, so I have a pretty amazing job. I am getting my master's degree in Library and Information Science. I want to either work as an archivist, a music librarian, or a medical librarian at a hospital (the Rock Hall would be a cool place to work too!)<br /><br />I know that sounds like an odd pathway perhaps, when I was so involved in music, but I never wanted to make music into a job for me, so I just keep up with it for fun now. When I was an undergrad I played one year in the Kent State University orchestra but stopped because it was too many hours a week with my major and minor, however I was always in other groups that played out around the city. I've been in a sort of indie rock group and also a bluegrass group since I was in college. We mostly play for fun and sometimes out too. I also got to record with a western swing group based near Oberlin.<br /><br />CYO I think gave me in part the courage to try different styles of music and play with other people. Despite being an English major, music is always an ever-present part of my life. I've also just played with and jammed with countless groups and people since coming to Kent, we have a great folk scene here and there is always something going on. I may go to Columbus in a month or so to record with a folk singer there (he calls himself American War).<br /><br />As for classical music, although I stopped playing in the Kent State orchestra, I took up singing. I've been singing in the Kent chorus now for two semesters. We sang Dona Nobis Pachem with the Canton Symphony this past spring which was incredible. I of course played violin so singing is new to me, but I'm getting to be a better vocalist by being in this group and following the example of others around me. It's comprised of community members and students.<br /><br />Which leads me to the point I'm trying to make; music has always been a way for me to feel a part of something no matter where I am and CYO opened up my mind so that I could play with so many types of people. I had no idea how to play bluegrass music a couple years ago but now I can. I had only ever read music off the page and I had no idea how to play leads or make parts up but since then I've improved a bit. I've met a girl who plays the mandolin and does a lot of Delta blues stuff. It's incredible the people you can find and connect with through music.<br /><br />So my advice to any CYO members would be--never stop making music. Even after college. There is really no excuse. You can always find local groups to sing or play with. You can do whatever you want for a job and keep music as your passion too.<br /><br />The other thing is to be proud of what you did in CYO. For me music is a way to connect with people and something to be proud of. Once you get to college people will be surprised and admiring that you can play violin or any instrument. Usually when I talk to people their biggest regret is that they didn't keep up with the instrument they were learning and I always try to explain to them that it's not too late, you can pick it up again or do something different.<br /><br />CYO also taught me to keep an open mind about all types of music. I still bring up in conversation when we played Symphonic Led Zeppelin, although that was four years ago. Four years is such a short time, but also a long time if those four years were your college years when you were growing up so much. I also got into writing poetry in college and it showed me that creativity flows over all levels... you can keep music, writing, anything really and it just makes you a more well-rounded, happy person no matter where you go. Some people go to the gym to relieve stress, I break out my violin and play.<br /><br />Thank you much for the experiences, I hope that this note finds you well and happy.</p>\r\n<p>Best, Jamie</p>\r\n<p>Jamie Bloss<br />Kent State University<br />The Honors College<br />A Community of Scholars</p>\r\n</blockquote>", "region": "content", "parent": 19}}, {"pk": 39, "model": "page.richtextcontent", "fields": {"ordering": 0, "text": "<h3>Jennifer Juan, Graphic Design</h3>\r\n<p>Jennifer has been the graphic designer for CYO since 2003.</p>\r\n<p>Jennifer received her degree in visual communication from Ohio State University, and has also studied graphic design at the Schule f&uuml;r Gestaltung in St. Gallen, Switzerland.

His father was an accomplished jazz saxophone and clarinet player. Common instruments could often be found lying around the house alongside instruments you wouldn't expect. From a baby grand piano (now in Stefan's living room inspiring his own children) to a sousaphone he practically had to climb into to play, it was all fair game.</p>\r\n<p>Like any teenager would, Stefan ultimately had to choose a loud instrument to play. Guitar was it. Years of lessons studying rock, classical, and jazz created a hybrid style that informs his work as a player and composer.</p>\r\n<p>Now a sought-after composer, arranger, and orchestrator, Stefan has created works for artists such as Jon Anderson of YES, Jefferson Starship, Evelyn Glennie, the Contemporary Youth Orchestra, and Sean Beeson.</p>\r\n<p>As a songwriter and musician, Stefan has won awards from the likes of Billboard Magazine and VH-1. He has shared the stage with performers such as Cheap Trick, Barenaked Ladies, and Dishwalla.</p>\r\n<p>Stefan has studied Spud Murphy's Equal Interval System &lt;http://equalinterval.com/&gt;&nbsp;<br />with David Blumberg &lt;http://tribute2david.com/&gt; and composition with Leon Willett &lt;http://leonwillett.com/&gt;</p>\r\n<p>http://stefanpodell.com/</p>", "region": "content", "parent": 42}}, {"pk": 52, "model": "page.richtextcontent", "fields": {"ordering": 1, "text": "<h2>The Citizens of Cuyahoga County through</h2>", "region": "content", "parent": 35}}, {"pk": 56, "model": "page.richtextcontent", "fields": {"ordering": 3, "text": "<p>This is a new text box</p>", "region": "content", "parent": 42}}, {"pk": 51, "model": "page.richtextcontent", "fields": {"ordering": 4, "text": "<h2><span>Foundations and Corporations</span></h2>", "region": "content", "parent": 35}}, {"pk": 53, "model": "page.richtextcontent", "fields": {"ordering": 17, "text": "<h2><span>Our INKIIND donors</span></h2>\r\n<p><span>Digital Edge Video</span> (Professional Support)<br /><span>Lighting (Professional Support)<br /></span></p>", "region": "content", "parent": 35}}, {"pk": 1, "model": "page.mediafilecontent", "fields": {"ordering": 0, "region": "concert_details", "type": "concertthumbnail", "parent": 5, "mediafile": 11}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "page.mediafilecontent", "fields": {"ordering": 0, "region": "images", "type": "ConcertThumbnail", "parent": 3, "mediafile": 5}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "page.mediafilecontent", "fields": {"ordering": 0, "region": "concert_details", "type": "concertthumbnail", "parent": 2, "mediafile": 10}}, {"pk": 6, "model": "page.mediafilecontent", "fields": {"ordering": 0, "region": "concert_details", "type": "ConcertThumbnail", "parent": 49, "mediafile": 7}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "page.mediafilecontent", "fields": {"ordering": 0, "region": "concert_details", "type": "ConcertThumbnail", "parent": 48, "mediafile": 4}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "page.mediafilecontent", "fields": {"ordering": 1, "region": "concert_details", "type": "concertthumbnail", "parent": 4, "mediafile": 13}}, {"pk": 5, "model": "page.mediafilecontent", "fields": {"ordering": 1, "region": "concert_details", "type": "ConcertThumbnail", "parent": 50, "mediafile": 6}}, {"pk": 1, "model": "page.applicationcontent", "fields": {"ordering": 0, "region": "content", "parent": 52, "parameters": "", "urlconf_path": "repertoire.concerts"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "page.applicationcontent", "fields": {"ordering": 0, "region": "concert_abstract", "parent": 53, "parameters": "", "urlconf_path": "repertoire.concerts"}}, {"pk": 5, "model": "page.applicationcontent", "fields": {"ordering": 1, "region": "content", "parent": 21, "parameters": "", "urlconf_path": "repertoire.urls"}}, {"pk": 1, "model": "page.featuredboxcontent", "fields": {"headliner": "Liquid Melancholy.
