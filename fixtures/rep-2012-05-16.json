It was first produced on October 16, 1938 at the Civic Opera House in Chicago.\r\n     The special character of Copland's music for Billy The Kid derives, in large part, from his subtle use of cowboy songs. The composer hoped that these folk tunes helped to create Ilan evocation of the storybook West\", and at the same time, he managed to confer upon them his own flavor. There can be no question that he succeeded brilliantly. As Leonard Bernstein once observed, \"It's not everybody who can make this kind of transformation and absorption. Copland has a particular genius for taking raw elements natural resources so to speak - and making them into serious language of his own.\"\r\n     \"Prairie Song\" is the beginning of the ballet. At night, under the stars, Billy is involved in a quiet card game with his outlaw friends. He is hunted by a posse led by his former friend, Pat Garret.

This work is by far the most popular of all the pieces commissioned by Richter.\r\n     Aaron Copland writes: \"When Mr. Richter first heard me play it from the piano sketch, he pointed out that it had an open air quality.

This 46 bar fanfare results from an unusual initiative taken by Eugene Goosens, the British born conductor of The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. In his foreword to the score, Goosens explained:\r\n     \"In the summer of 1942 I decided to carry out an experiment at our Cincinnati concerts similar to the one I had previously essayed with some success at my concerts of contemporary music at Queens Hall, London, in 1921. I therefore wrote to a number of American Composers of repute requesting them to compose patriotic fanfares for performance at the concerts of The Cincinnati Symphony during the 1942-43 season. No fewer than eighteen composers immediately responded with fanfares for different combinations of instruments...\"\r\n     Ten of the fanfares were written for the combination of brass and percussion, and were published in a single volume, with Copland's as the first. Little needs to be said about the work itself, which makes as strong an impression today as it must have when it was first heard against the dark background of America's entrance into World War II.\r\n     It is interesting to note the other nine fanfares in the volume: Fanfare for the Forces of our Latin American Allies (Henry Cowell), Fanfare for Paratroopers (Paul Creston), Fanfare for the Medical Corps (Anis Fuleihan), Fanfare for the Merchant Marine (Eugene Goosens), Fanfare for the Signal Corps (Howard Hansen), Fanfare for the Fighting French (Walter Piston), Fanfare for Russia (Deems Taylor), Fanfare for France (Virgil Thomson), and Fanfare for Airmen (Bernard Wagenaar). Copland's fanfare has stood above all of them. It was completed at Oakland, N.J. on November 6, 1942 and first heard in Cincinnati on March 14, 1943. Copland was so pleased with his work that three years later he returned to the piece, elaborating it, and using it to introduce the final movement of his Third Symphony.\r\n", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 16, "conductor": [7], "song": 4, "premiere": "d", "note": "\"In writing {The Tender Land: Suite}, I was trying to give young American singers material that they do not often get in the opera house; that is, material that would be natural for them to sing and perform.

Created by George Herriman (1880-1944), the main characters\u0097Krazy Kat, Ignatz Mouse, Officer Pupp\u0097turned the traditional mouse-cat-dog hierarchy on its ear: in this case, the cat loved the mouse, mouse threw bricks at the cat, which the cat took as unending signs of love, and the dog tried to protect the cat.  By the time John Alden Carpenter (1876-1951) used the premise of the strip as the basis for a ballet, the strip was at the height of its popularity. A native of Chicago, Carpenter\u0092s exposure to some of the earliest performances of jazz in the northern United States led him to incorporate the new sounds into several of his instrumental works, at a time when much of the United States had no idea what the word \u0093jazz\u0094 even meant. Krazy Kat is subtitled A Jazz Pantomime; the stage directions (printed below) were meant to be acted out by characters in costume in front of a massive, moving background (not unlike an animated cartoon), which had been created by Herriman himself. Krazy Kat was first performed at Town Hall in New York on Friday, January 20, 1922, with Adolph Bohm acting the part of Krazy (and choreographing the show), and conducted by George Barr\u00e8re.\r\n\r\nKrazy Kat\r\n \u0093To those who have not mastered Mr. Herriman\u0092s psychology it may be explained that Krazy Kat is the world\u0092s greatest optimist\u0097Don Quixote and Parsifal rolled into one. It is therefore possible for him to maintain constantly at white heat a passionate affair with Ignatz Mouse in which the gender of each remains ever a delightful mystery. Ignatz, on the other hand, condenses in his sexless self all the cardinal vices. If Krazy blows beautiful bubbles, Ignatz shatters them; if he builds castles in Spain, Ignatz is there with the brick. In short, he is meaner than anything, and his complex is cats.\r\n\u0093After a few introductory bars the curtain is raised and Krazy is discovered asleep under a tree. Officer Pup passes, swinging his club. All is well. Then comes Bill Postem, a canine relative of Officer Pup, with his bucket and brush, and pastes upon the wall an announcement of the grand ball which will shortly be given for all the animals, The job finished, Bill departs.\r\n\u0093Krazy wakes up; he rubs his eyes and reads the exciting poster. He is moved to try his steps; he find his feet heavy and numerous. Of a sudden he spies on a clothes line which the moving scenery has brought into view, a ballet skirt. Undoubtedly it is his costume for the all. He approaches the clothes line, first with restraint, then with eagerness. He snatches the skirt from the line, claps it one, and comes bounding forward in high abandon.\r\n\u0093He is interrupted by the appearance of Old Joe Stork, drilling by with his bundle on his back. He passes on, but he has carelessly dropped his pack. Krazy sniffs at it, filled with curiosity. He picks it up and carries it triumphantly to his tree in the corner. He opens the bundle, and finds that it contains not what you thought it would, but a vanity case, mirror, rouge, powder-puff, lip-stick and all, complete, including a beautiful pair of white cotton gloves.\r\n\u0093He abandons himself to the absorbing task of make-up for the ball. Meanwhile the moving scenery has brought into view the house of Ignatz Mouse. The door opens, and Ignatz\u0092 head appears. Opportunity has knocked. The Mouse steals forward and is about to seize an inviting brick when Officer Pup (thank heaven!) arrives in the very nick of time and drives him from the scene. The unsuspecting Kat, in the meantime, has completed his make-up He now arises, draws on his white cotton gloves, and then by way of further preparatory exercise, he indulges in a bit of a Spanish dance.\r\n\t\u0093At its conclusion Krazy is suddenly confronted by the Mysterious Stranger. The sophisticated audience will observe that it is none other than Ignatz disguised as a catnip merchant. Very formidable indeed! The Stranger steps briskly forward and holds out to the ever-receptive Kat a bouquet\u0097an enormous bouquet of catnip. Krazy plunges his nose into the insidious vegetable, inhales deeply to the very bottom of his lungs, and then goes off at once into what Mr. Herriman calls a Class A fit. It is a fit progressive, a fit de luxe, the Katnip blues, in which the wily Ignatz joins as additional incitement. When the frenzy has achieved its climax, the Mouse throws off his disguise, seizes his brick, dashes it full in the face of the Kat, and escapes. Krazy staggers back, stunned and exhausted, but yet undaunted. Ther is the moment of ecstatic recognition\u0097Ignatz Dahlink\u0097as he totters and reels back to his little tree. He sinks down wearily under its protecting boughs. The moon comes out. Krazy sleeps. Krazy dreams.

Essentially it is concerned with a celebration of the Roman ritual using the Latin text of the Catholic liturgy; but simultaneously there is a subtext in English reflecting the reactions, doubts, protests, and questionings - positive and negative - of all of us who are attending and perceiving this ritual. By \"all of us\" I mean to include all who are assembled on stage and, by extension, the audience itself.\r\n     The ritual is conducted by a young man of mysterious simplicity (called the Celebrant) who throughout the drama is invested by his acolytes with increasingly ornate robes and symbols which connote both an increase in the superficial formalism of his obligation and of the burden that he bears. There is a parallel increase in the resistance of the Congregants - in the sharpness and bitterness of their reactions and in the deterioration of his own faith. At the climax of Communion, all ceremony breaks down and the Mass is shattered. It then remains for each individual on the stage to find a new seed of faith within himself through painful meditation, enabling each individual to pass on the embrace of peace (Pax) to his neighbor. This chain of embrace grows and spreads through the entire stage, ultimately into the audience and hopefully into the world outside.\r\n     The disposition of forces at the original production was: in the pit, an orchestra of strings only, plus two organs and a percussion section.

There are three choruses: a formal choir seated in pews, a Boys' Choir, and a so-called Street Chorus, many of whom function as vocal or dancing soloists and groups. All these forces perform with, against, or around the Celebrant.

An ever-advancing economy of musical means and tightening of structure proceeds from one show to the next. It was almost predictable from this trend that when West Side Story hit Broadway like a bombshell, in September 1957, it would be hailed as a landmark in American theater. It was indeed recognized as a major leap toward an original kind of theatrical conception. Bernstein had speculated much earlier that a genuine, indigenous form of American musical theater would eventually arise out of what has been known as musical comedy. Many people think that, in {West Side Story}, this theory began to be implemented. Elements from the European and American musical stage traditions were fused into an original art form that is neither opera nor musical comedy.\r\n     From the Old World tradition came complicated vocal ensembles, such as the {Quintet} in Act 1; the use of music to project the story line forward (as in the duet \"A Boy Like That\"); the dramatic device of {leitmotifs} - for instance, the one associated with the reality of gang violence, as in the {Prologue}, or the one associated with the diametrically opposite vision of togetherness, as in the Finale.In addition, from Europe came the deductive-inductive species of developing musical materials, by basing much of the {West Side Story} score on transformations of the tritone interval, or by immediately developing the opening statement of any given song with melodic or rhythmic variation.\r\n     From the New World came idiomatic jazz and Latin timbres and figurations (most of the dance music); a fluid and constant change from word to music and from scene to scene, such as the second-act ballet that goes from accompanied spoken word into song, into dance and back again; and most important, the kinetic approach to the stage - communication though choreographic music - delineated, in concentrated form, by these {Symphonic Dances}.\r\n     Why are these dances called symphonic? Simply because the dance music, even in its original format, is symphonically conceived. Relatively few thematic ideas, combined with each other and metamorphosed into completely new shapes, are all that are necessary to meet varying dramatic requirements. This music on its own terms, music that does not have to depend upon presupposed knowledge of the unfolding events on stage.\r\n     However, for those who are interested in knowing what transpires on stage during the course of the dances, the following summary outlines the principal sections of the music (which is arranged so that one section flows into the next without a break):\r\n\r\n{Prologue} (Allegro moderato)\r\n     The growing rivalry between two teenage gangs, the Jets and the Sharks.\r\n\r\n{Somewhere} (Adagio)\r\n     In a dream ballet, the two gangs are united in friendship.\r\n\r\n{Scherzo} (Vivace e leggiero)\r\n     In the same dream, the gangs break away from the city walls, suddenly finding themselves in a playful world of space, air and sun.\r\n\r\n{Manbo} (Meno Presto)\r\n     In the real world again, the competitive dance at the gym between the gangs.\r\n\r\n{Cha-cha} (Andantino con grazia)\r\n     The star-crossed lovers Tony and Maria see each other for the first time; they dance together.\r\n\r\n{Meeting Scene} (Meno mosso)\r\n     Music accompanies their first words spoken to one another.\r\n\r\n{Cool Fugue} (Allegretto)\r\n     An elaborate dance sequence in which Riff leads the Jets in harnessing their impulsive hostility, figuratively \"cooling their jets.\"\r\n\r\n{Finale} (Adagio)\r\n     Maria's \"I Have a Love\" develops into a procession, which recalls the vision of \"Somewhere\".\r\n    - Jack Gottlieb", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 22, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 7, "conductor": [181], "song": 21, "premiere": "a", "note": "When Kris Brooks (b. 1969) was only fourteen years of age, he heard a recording of music by J.S.

The homs usher in each of the five themes. The introduction is a genial, syncopated dance, expressing Holst's 'other life' of school singing and Morley college festivities.

The grandest of these arenas was the Circus Maxhnus in Rome which was nearly a mile in circumference and could hold more than 180,000 spectators.\r\n     Chariot races were the most popular event at the circus where wagers were taken on the outcome. However, the arena was used for just about any other event, especially if carnage was incorporated. Gladiators would be found fighting either each other or wild beasts. The wild beasts would fight other wild beasts, or they would entertain the massive crowd by devouring, condemned criminals and Christians. Occasionally, the floor of the arena was flooded for mock naval battles. The Circus Maximus set the standard for all other amphitheaters in the Empire, and was housed in We well-known Colosseum, the ruins of which still stand in the center of Rome.\r\n     The programmatic nature of [Circus Maximus] is one of emotional rather than pictorial content.

At this moment Colas enters, laughing when he sees the destruction.\r\n     The scene changes to a procession to celebrate the town's patron saint.

One of its 35 separate sections, subtitled \"Sabre Dance\", actually reached the front of the American Hit parade in 1948. Gayne, in full stage dress, is an entertainment of gargantuan proportions by western standards.\r\n     The first full production of Gayne took place on December 9, 1942 in Molotov, Russia. The principals of the ballet can be simply broken down to three - a patriotic wife, her not-so-patriotic husband, and a patriotic \"other man\". This \"other man\" presides over the liquidation of the husband and marries the wife. Gayne's breadwinner, Griko, is depicted as a drunken, villainous lout, altogether so undesirable that one wonders what she ever saw in him. Whatever her reason for accepting his bread and board, she almost pays dearly for it. Discovering that Griko has fallen in with a band of smugglers, she denounces him, privately at first, and then, after he set fire to her property, publicly. Griko attempts to kill her, along with their daughter. At the last possible moment, enter the redoubtable Kazakov, of the Red Army border patrol and secret love of Gayne.

His record albums have sold in excess of 30 million copies, and his 20 Grammy awards stood on the shelves of his home next to four Oscar statuettes.\r\n     Yet, in spite of his fame, Henry Mancini remained a very private man. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of poor, yet hardworking Italian parents. His love for music began at age 12 while listening to big bands in movie palaces, and his talent was recognized before he was 20.\r\n     He struggled in Hollywood writing for low budget thrillers arid waited anxiously for a word of approval. The sudden success of his theme for TV's Peter Gunn brought him fame as a recording star.\r\n     The soundtrack for file movie {The White Dawn} was written in 1974. It is about three Boston Whalers stranded around Baffin Bay early in this century. These three sailors, lost on an ice floe, are found by lnuits. The story raises questions as to who is actually civilized.\r\n     Mancini was concerned about what to do with Inuit music. He found that all they had in the way of music was the human voice (which is, of course, the first instrument), and some drums made of hoops stretched with walrus or seal bladders. Phil Kaufman, who directed the picture, had recorded an old Inuit woman singing a chant. She was right on pitch with the European tempered scale, so much that Mancini was able to take her voice and put orchestra behind it. You can hear her chant in the first flute melody that then transfers to the strings in file beginning of the piece.\r\n     The White Dawn was a film composer's dream because there were so many open sequences with no sound except the wind.

The rhythmic intensity that permeates the piece is coupled with the Irrepressible emergence of inspiring melodic lines. The opening polytonal trumpet and trombone fanfare is continued rhythmically by the horns and taolas, while the violins and upper woodwinds brightly display the principal theme. The overture's lyrical theme is introduced by the cellos and bassoons, eventually building to an orchestra] tutti. The fanfare reappears after which a now \"American\" theme is introduced by the clarinet and echoed by the trumpet. These three themes form the basis for the entire Overture, and the transformation and realization of these themes provide coherence to the work.\r\n      While the title Overture for Our City certainly connotes my home of Buffalo, New York, a larger context is also intended. The \"city'may be Interpreted numerous ways, and as I wrote this piece I thought about the many aspects of the emotional appeal of music. The often indescribable pleasure and joy that music brings to the life of human beings Is both an intensely personal and overtly communal experience. The importance of the relationship between music and a city is Atal to our society - it is a relationship that should always be cherished. It is in this city, in our \"American City' - our \"city of the world\" - that music is created and music flourishes. The production of the score and parts to Overture for our City is funded in part by the Margaret Fadrbank Jory Copying Assistance Program of the American Music Center, made possible through grants from the National Endowment of the Arts, Mary Flagier Cary Charitable Trust, Helen F.

In it, Schuman has created the sonic equivalent of the typical '30s and '40s newsreel that customarily preceded the feature film at a Saturday matinee. The aural imagery is obvious enough, and a sense of humor bordering on burlesque animates various parts, not least Fashion Show and Monkeyv at the Zoo.

His father's taste was ultra-conservative, and Strauss's own juvenilia are stylistically rooted and grounded in the German classics. He later declared that a really firm and forward looking idiom was impossible without a thorough command of classical technique and language. And so this concerto, the earliest of Strauss's instrumental works to retain a place in the repertory, sounds not like the composer of Der Rosenkavalier or even Don Juan, but like a very spirited Mendelssohn.\r\n     Compared with the second concerto it is very heavily scored, with a lot of tutti ritomello work (which (Hans von) Bulow wanted to shorten); but despite differences in style, the two works share a similar attitude to the horn and similar types of musical invention. The opening melody is firmly diatonic in character. As the concerto progresses it will be noticed ... the slow movement begins in A flat minor (an extravagant key-seven flats in the signature), with an accompaniment figure borrowed from the first movement. No performance of this concerto by Franz Strauss is recorded in the catalogue of his son's works, but it is known that he played it with a high B flat crook (as Dennis Brain did). The concerto was first played at Meiningen under [Hans von] Bulow with Gustav Leinhos, the excellent principal of the orchestra there, as soloist. This premiere took place in 1885, though Strauss had been promised it for the previous year.

This is a description, again, of the atmosphere, not a person necessarily born under this sign. \r\n{The Snake}: \r\nSolutions and compromises can be arrived at, but not without some mutual distrust at first. The Snake likes to resolve his differences one way or another. If he fails and things cannot be peacefully settled, then he will declare war. Looking back into history, we find that the year of the Snake has never been tranquil. \r\nPerhaps this is because it is the strongest negative force in the cycle and it follows the Dragon year, which is the strongest positive one. Many disasters, which had their beginning in the year of the Dragon, tend to culminate in the year of the Snake. These two signs are very closely related and the calamities of the Snake years often resulted from excesses committed during the Dragon's reign. The Snake's cool and collected front hides the deep and mysterious ways of his nature. It should be noted that once the Snake uncoils to strike, he moves like lightning and nothing can stop him. Similarly, changes that occur during the Snake's year can be as sudden and devastating.Tread lightly and be more cautious this year. The consequences will be overwhelming. The Snake is not merciful. \r\nI had decided to program Sensemaya for this concert this past June. After the tragedies this past September, I almost pulled the work from the program, thinking that it would be inappropriate to study a piece that was based on a poem about killing a living thing. After taking some time to ponder this, I then remembered that this is the year of the snake. I thought it important at that point to keep it on the program; through the study of this work, it has been emphasized in rehearsals that our interpretation of this piece would be to put at end to the wicked and foul atmosphere that the snake can create. With that in mind, we are focused on somehow helping to bring peace to our world, and an end to lives lost at the hands of evil.                                                                   \r\n~Liza Grossman \r\n\r\nSENSEMAYA   chant to kill a snake.

More than a hundred years of performance have demonstrated this verdict to be false, since the work is now undoubtedly one of the most popular of all Romantic piano concertos.

The Flute Concerto was preceded by concertos for cello and piano. Soon after came the Violin Concerto and the Oboe Concerto. Many new concertos have been written in the last few years, however musicians that want to play them are usually being hired by the orchestras to sell a subscription series with warehouses of the literature. All solo instrumentalists must compete with first-desk players for rare solo spots. Notwithstanding this situation, flutist Carol Wincenc was eager for a concerto from Tower. Wincenc had had enormous success with another new concerto, Lukas Foss\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Renaissance Concerto, and  is strongly commited to expanding the flute repertoire. Tower had previously written Snow Dreams for her and guitarist Sharon Isbin, and Wincenc had \u00e2\u0080\u009cenormous personal affection for Joan as an individual and as a player. She is a complete musician in every sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wincenc particularly admires Tower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfantastic understanding of the line,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and believed that Tower would write a piece to show off the flute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lyrical and virtuosic qualities advantageously. On Tower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, she admits that it was particularly intimidating to write a Flute Concerto: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always faced with the problem of the flute being overpowered by the orchestra. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to keep the orchestra away from the flute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She solved the dilemma by keeping the orchestra small and entirely omitting \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsorbing\u00e2\u0080\u009d instruments such as the horn. She limited the use of the flute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quiet lower register to the unusual and lovely soliloquy with which the concerto commences. Tower keeps the soloist busy, and engages it in several duets with the orchestra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flute and percussion. The soloist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figurations include rapid scales and arpeggios as well as melodic patterns that emphasize thirds, fifths and octaves. Tower told Wincenc that these \u00e2\u0080\u009copen intervals\u00e2\u0080\u009d evoke a \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrand Canyon feeling\u00e2\u0080\u009d for her. The composer and original soloist spent long hours  together refining matters of articulation and phrase length. The Concerto gets progressively more energetic. It winds up first to a climax in which the release of energy gives way to a cadenza, and then again to the \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh voltage ending\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In part this was planned from the start, but when the Concerto was 80 percent completed, Wincenc and Tower had a reading session.

It was, however, too difficult to re-write directly from what I had been given. I asked him if I could re-work the piece as my own, using his ideas. He gave me a terrific structure to work with; the framework was solid.  I ended up writing the concerto with him in mind as the soloist.  As far as the outline of the piece, I kept to his idea of dividing the movements up in the orchestra; that is giving the first movement to the strings, second to the brass, third to the woodwinds. I added the elements of having the percussion section play each movement with the soloist, and bringing the entire orchestra together on the fourth movement, which recalls the style and motifs of the first movement.

Sibelius was detached from blatant political measures yet he subtly participated in nationalistic activities by portraying patriotism through his music.  \r\n\r\nSibelius composed music for a series of tableaux on themes of Finnish historical events. Finlandia accompanied the final tableaux which portrayed the devastation of Finland during the 18th century Nordic war. The text that accompanied this music read, (in part): \"The powers of darkness menacing Finland have not succeeded in their terrible threats. Finland awakes...\"        His prelude music to Finland Awakes!  was so popular that he eventually took it from the suite and published it separately in 1900 as Finlandia. The work became a symbol of Finnish nationalism. While Finland was still a Grand Duchy under Russia, performances of the work had to take place under the covert title {Impromptu}. \r\n\r\nIn Finland, the Finlandia Hymn was not sung until Finnish words were written by the opera singer W\u00c3\u00a4in\u00c3\u00b6 Sola in 1937. After the Russian aggression against Finland in 1939 (The Winter War) the Finnish poet V.A. Koskenniemi wrote the text that has been used ever since.

Musical depiction of the paintings' subject matter was not a concern or a consideration. Rather the relationship is confined to technique in matters of harmony and dissonance, of color and light, energy and intensity of brush stroke, shape, clarity, and focus of image, and their overall formal structural deployment. Nevertheless, Van Gogh painted and drew with such fervor and passion that often the technical aspects of his work are simultaneous translations of his own inner turmoil, anxiety, rage, joy, love, and depression.\r\n\r\nListeners can determine to what extent a musical \"transcription\" of the art work carries corresponding emotive qualities.\r\n\r\n4. {The Night Cafe}\r\nThere are two paintings of cafes at night: one an outdoor scene with light flooding from the windows, illuminating the sidewalks, chairs, and tables against a starlit night sky; the other (The All-Night Cafe) is a desolate interior scene depicted in the most extreme color contrasts; \"blood red and dark yellow with a green billiard table in the middle; there are four citron-yellow lamps with a glow of orange and green. Everywhere there is a clash....\"\r\n\r\n5. {Dance at Arles}\r\nA complex of figures dancing, painted in somber colors with the jet-black hair and hats of the women giving a macabre quality to the social scene.\r\n\r\n6. {The Church at Auvers}\r\nPainted in bold, simple lines allied to an electric quality of color - a cobalt-blue sky and acid-green grass. A fragment of a hymn was found in the prayer book that Van Gogh used during his ministry in the Borinage (a Belgian coal-mining area where he worked as a Calvinist missionary in his twenties). That fragment helped to generate much of the musical material of the two suites.\r\n\r\nSuite No. 2 was commissioned by the Koussevitzky Foundation and is dedicated to the memory of Serge and Natalie Koussevitzky.

His violin compositions are standards of the virtuoso repertoire. His most famous works for the instrument\u00e2\u0080\u0094Havanaise, Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, and the Third Concerto in B minor\u00e2\u0080\u0094were each instant successes, featuring saucy Iberian themes, virtuosic tricks, and powerful climaxes. The Concerto is also popular as a debut vehicle, and such artists as Hilary Hahn, Leila Josefowicz, and Pinchas Zukerman all made Cleveland Orchestra debuts with the piece.                                                                         \r\n\r\nDedicated to the Spanish violinist Pablo de Sarasate, the B minor Concerto has elements of French, Spanish, and Italian motives. The first movement, representing an easygoing, Parisian feel, quickly became popular with the audiences due to its \"poetic atmosphere and compelling melodiousness\" (George Bernard Shaw). The movement is in A-B-A-B-A form, with sentimental phrases sandwiched between pyrotechnical exploits. The original opening melody, played for the first thirty bars on the violin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lowest string, the G-string, returns to launch the coda, driven by an ever increasing crescendo and tempo, utilizing every position on the instrument. \r\n\r\nThe second movement, based off of a simple Siciliano melody, is very much chamber music between the solo violin and principal winds, as the phrase is handed back and forth between the oboe, flute, clarinet, and violin. The rhythmic pulse is leisurely, the mood is always uplifting, and the soaring melodies demonstrate the vocal qualities of the instrument. The violin concludes the movement with arpeggios in artificial harmonics. \r\n\r\nThe third movement begins with a rhapsodic, cadenza feeling, leading to a sensuous, energetic Spanish theme that is reminiscent of the dedicatee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (de Sarasate) own music. The movement is fast-paced until the orchestral violins introduce the secondary melody, which is the only lapse in the spirited pulse. The tension and virtuosity increase until the coda, marked Presto. The movement finishes with a dynamic flourish, bringing the concerto to a heroic ending. \r\n\r\nPablo de Sarasate premiered the concerto in 1881, and the concerto was published the following year. I first learned this concerto when I was 14 in Vermont, and again in the summer of 2003. It has always been one of my favorites due to it's accessibility and rich themes. The concerto shows off many palettes of the instrument, and is ultimately a rewarding piece. \r\nI would like to dedicate this performance to twelve years of inspiring guidance and friendship from Ms. Liza Grossman. \r\n\r\n~Andrew Sords March, 2004", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 118, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 28, "conductor": [181], "song": 114, "premiere": "a", "note": "Life without music would be impossible.

They were the products of an extra-ordinary human will, and now, stripped of their original function by the unstoppable erosion of time, they serve only one purpose - to stand up.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps there is more. One cannot help but appreciate the vast scale of such magnificent human achievements in light of life's inevitable decay. We know we will die, poised on the very brink of our own extinction, yet we still strive to transcend our own mortality, in defiance of fate. We hold our heroes very dear to our hearts - we praise them and their achievements, and in praising we ourselves begin to succumb to the glory of it all.

Not that I would ever claim to be anywhere close to Mahler, perhaps the most perfect purveyor of this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but to try to capture pain in both its universal semblance as it simultaneously relates to each and every individual is what this piece is meant to convey. The symphony of the late Romantic period was often set in a minor key with some sort of explosion to major at the conclusion\u00e2\u0080\u0093 to bring dark to light, as it were. This piece begins dark, and stays dark and gets darker. \r\n \r\nThe clich\u00c3\u00a9s of what causes one heartbreak are indeed such clich\u00c3\u00a9s that we often disregard their power. The death of a loved one, the loss of a spouse or a friend or a lover, the never ending underlying pain in the gut you wonder will ever go away \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these are the feelings I called upon when I started constructing this piece. I had a small sketch with nothing but \u00e2\u0080\u009cDark Morning\u00e2\u0080\u009d written on it from years ago which became the motive the solo trumpet declares at m.15 of the first tableau. \r\n \r\nThere is something about night that always seems much more conducive to those in pain. When someone is in dark despair, the night becomes some sort of blanket for one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pain and tears. The darkness and the relative lack of activity seem to almost tell you that, for those dark hours, the world understands. But if anyone has ever seen the sun begin to rise, on a day when you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure how much longer you can go on, then one can begin to perhaps understanding what I am trying to convey by the titles of the sections of this piece. The underlying theme is always of not wanting the night to leave, no matter how painful. The promise of the coming day\u00e2\u0080\u0093 something we should always usually thank God for (or the deity of your choice) becomes nothing but a horror that magnifies the despair\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the sunrise mocking the pain. The morning where everyone normal goes about their daily life and duties when you are in so much grief you are afraid you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk across the floor\u00e2\u0080\u0093 THIS is what I have attempted to convey in this very dark work.\r\n \r\nMusically set in 5 sections I have called Tableau (Thank you Mr. Debussy and Mr. Stravinsky) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of which have tutti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with material of such extensive importance that inspired me to change the title designation from just Concerto to Concerto/Symphony \u00e2\u0080\u0093 each section has a mood and a numerology description in the form of a time. \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU I: 3:28am - The Morning You Left Me}\r\nThis tableau has the first announcement of the soloists giving the notes F# B D C#\u00e2\u0080\u0093 which generate a great amount of the material for the whole piece. Different rhythmic patterns alternate to convey pain bordering on psychosis. \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU II: 4:18am \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The Morning the Snowfall Tried to Comfort Me; I Preferred the Snowstorm}\r\nA calm arpeggiated figure meant to illustrate falling snow, interrupted by a very intense snowstorm\u00e2\u0080\u0093 to this point in my career the most complex music I have ever written with the snowstorm music containing seven different ideas going on at once. \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU III: 2:26am \u00e2\u0080\u0093 My Pain Dances like the Spilled Scotch in the Firelight and like the Dead Leaves in the Wind.}\r\nThis is an angry, and oft-syncopated dance meant to convey a very sad person watching leaves blow in an angry, biting wind.  \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU IV: Painful, Sad Recollections of the Mornings (cadenza); March and Fugue over Dreading the Sunrise}\r\nA cadenza for the soloists opens this section and then 2 long sections of fugue themes\u00e2\u0080\u0093 one a death march \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one more of a blare meant to imply angst at the coming sunrise.  \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU V: 6:36am \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Pain and Anger at the Sunrise}\r\nThere is a long build of juxtaposed chords before a theme, which to me sounds like off-kilter Shostakovich\u00e2\u0080\u0093 this theme mixed in with a rock rhythm. The piece grows more and more frenzied until the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime\u00e2\u0080\u009d of this piece\u00e2\u0080\u0093 6:36 AM is revealed in the intro to the coda - 6 very loud plucked strings and harp and chime chords, followed by three 12-tone rows in the winds. The opening string flourish from the beginning of the piece leads to the rock rhythm ending in one final primal scream of pain\u00e2\u0080\u0093 before the rock rhythm brings the piece to a close with a loud burst of despair. \r\n \r\nDespite all the darkness in the piece, may I say again how proud, blessed and thankful I am for my music having been connected to CYO for now more than half its existence. The recognition it has brought for my music and career is inestimable and I could not be more thrilled to write another piece for the Contemporary Youth Orchestra and two members of the Cleveland Orchestra. I hope the joy in creating this premiere is as equally proportional to all the pain that was recalled in the creation of the music.   \r\n\r\nP.

Early in November I moved from St. Petersburg to a dacha belonging to the Rimsky-Korsakov family... I went there for a vacation in birch forests and snow-fresh air, but instead began to work on The Firebird. Andrei Rimsky-Korsakov (son of the composer) was with me at the time, as he often was during the following months; because of this, The Firebird is dedicated to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d}    \r\n~Stravinsky                                      \r\n\r\n                                                 \r\nStravinsky evokes the world of an old Russian fairy tale in his music:\r\n\r\n[This is the story of Prince Ivan Tsarevich who, during a hunting excursion at night, finds himself in an enchanted garden where golden apples grow on silver trees.

Heated and spewing evil from his being, the fearsome Kastchei begins to turn Ivan to stone. The Prince avoids being petrified by holding up the Firebird's feather. At the height of the battle, the Firebird herself appears! The presence of her magical, peaceful being causes the monsters and the sorcerer to break into a frenzied dance.

The music for humans \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Prince Ivan, the thirteen Princesses, and characters in the Finale - is almost all diatonic (notes within the scale). The supernatural characters - Kastchei and the Firebird - are depicted by chromatic notes (notes outside the basic scale). Kastchei\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character is based on the interval of a {tritone.} (two notes that are three whole steps apart played simultaneously)\r\nJ.S. Bach, (1685-1750), a church organist and composer, was forbidden from using the {tritone} in music. Its strained sound was considered to be \u00e2\u0080\u0098the devils chord\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\r\n(Bach did sneak it in, but as notes in succession)\r\n\r\n{\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was more proud of some of the orchestration than of the music itself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d} Stravinsky recalled. {\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe natural-harmonic string glissando near the beginning, which the bass chord touches off like a Catherine-wheel (revolving firework). I was delighted to have discovered this, and I remember my excitement in demonstrating it to Rimsky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violinist and cellist sons. I remember, too, Richard Strauss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s astonishment when he heard it two years later in Berlin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d}\r\n\r\nRhythmic originality is present, with the syncopated bass of the {Firebird's Dance} under the fluttering woodwinds and the insistent beat of the {Infernal Dance.} Most notable to the composer himself, the {Finale} shows {\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first appearance in my music of metrical irregularity\u00e2\u0080\u0094the 7/4 bars subdivided into 1-2-3/1-2/1-2; 1-2/1-2/1-2-3 etc.\u00e2\u0080\u009d} \r\n\r\nWe are attracted to the {Firebird} by the romanticism of the tale and the expressiveness of the music.

It is dedicated with gratitude and affection to Contemporary Youth Orchestra Music Director Liza Grossman. \r\n\r\nIt was an invaluable opportunity and great pleasure for me to have performed with the Contemporary Youth Orchestra for three seasons (2000-03). During this period, I was fortunate to have been introduced to exciting new music of the twentieth-century and to have been challenged musically, technically and artistically. I look back very fondly on my years with the orchestra as a period of vital discovery and growth. Consequently, {Manhattan Dawn} is intended to be a reflection on the inspiring and nurturing experience that the Contemporary Youth Orchestra has provided to so many young musicians during its first decade. \r\n\r\nIn the early stages of writing this piece, I discovered the work of the American poet Donald Justice and was struck by his interest in reflecting on his past from a remove. The title of one of his poems, {Manhattan Dawn (1945)}, seemed appropriate for my own work for this occasion. Although my piece is not programmatic, the juxtaposed images of Manhattan, where I live and study during the school year, and the reflection of past memories, suggested a resonant title for my own work. \r\n\r\nThe work consists of three connected sections that are fundamentally fast-slow-fast. The opening section introduces the main musical material, which endeavors to be energetic and lively. The middle section introduces a lyrical theme which is passed around the orchestra. The third and final section functions as a summation of the earlier episodes and leads to a loud and raucous culmination.\r\n\r\n~Ryan Gallagher\r\nc 2005", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 124, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 30, "conductor": [181], "song": 120, "premiere": "a", "note": "{Rhapsody for Violin and Orchestra is the first work composed and performed by a current CYO  member.

He began studying at St. Petersburg Conservatory at the age of ten, and produced his first major musical achievement, his First Symphony, at age nineteen. He would later become a composition teacher at the Conservatory. As a composer in Communist Russia, Shostakovich's music was often condemned by Stalin and the Communist government as being too formalistic. With Stalin's death in 1953 came the end of Shostakovich's musical oppression. Shostakovich greatly admired the music of Bach, Beethoven, Mahler, and Berg, and the influence of these composers shows through in much of Shostakovich's music. He is most well-known for his symphonies and his string quartets. Shostakovich died of lung cancer in 1975 in Moscow. \r\n\r\nThe Second Piano Concerto, written in 1957, was a nineteenth birthday present for the composer's son, Maxim. Maxim premiered the concerto on May 10, 1957, with the U.S.S.R State Symphony. Unlike a good deal of Shostakovich's other compositions, the concerto is devoid of all codes and hidden messages. Instead, it is full of such energy, vitality, and mischief that it is considered to be a \"character study\" of Maxim. The light-hearted vigor of this piece is also thought to be owed to the death of Stalin. The third movement is a quick-stepping Allegro, in which the momentum never ceases. The end of the slow second movement leads directly into the chattering duple-time opening of the third movement. This first theme is interrupted by a lively 7/8 theme, which recurs several times throughout the movement. The third movement is filled with passages of scales and arpeggios that are taken directly out of the Hanon finger exercises which, according to the composer, were included in the concerto because this was the only way that he could get his son to practice them. The first theme of the movement is brought back at the end, and the concerto ends in a brilliant finale.\r\n\r\n~Gina Ardillo\r\n2005", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 126, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 30, "conductor": [181], "song": 122, "premiere": "d", "note": "{This performance of Schelomo is a result of the CYO concerto opportunity auditions.

Bloch wrote most of his music in Geneva, where he had his second period, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cJewish Cycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He composed Schelomo:Hebraic Rhapsody for Violoncello and Orchestra in 1916.  The works that Bloch wrote during the Jewish Cycle are the works that he is famous for today, although they make up less than 20 percent of his pieces.  He did not borrow from other traditional works, but rather he considered his compositions his own works, which borrowed the soul of the Hebrew Scriptures.  As William Henrichs said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is Jewish\u00e2\u0080\u00a6in the same sense that Debussy was French, Sibelius Finnish, or Bart\u00c3\u00b4k Hungarian, and in that sense he may be identified with a kind of Hebrew Nationalism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bloch founded the Cleveland Institute of Music in 1920 and directed it until 1925.  He also directed the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and taught at the University of California at Berkeley.  \r\n\tDuring his Jewish period, Bloch began to develop ideas for a work based on Solomon (Schelomo being Solomon in Hebrew) and the book of Ecclesiastes, which is attributed to Solomon.  At the time, Bloch was concerned with the harshness of war, World War I having just broken out the year before, and began writing this piece for voice and orchestra.  He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor years I had been sketching a musical setting of Ecclesiastes, but neither French, German, nor English suited my purpose and I did not know enough Hebrew\u00e2\u0080\u00a6One day I met the cellist Alexander Barjansky...I began to think about writing a work for that marvelous cellist.  Why not use my Ecclesiastes material, but instead of a human voice, limited by a text, employ an infinitely grander and more profound voice that could speak all languages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that of his violoncello?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The work displays a huge amount of emotional intensity. The solo cello plays a meditative voice of Solomon and the orchestra represents the voice of the world around Solomon, and also at times, his inner voice.\r\n\r\n\tSchelomo is divided into three large sections, each with a grand orchestral interlude.  The opening of the piece starts with a cello cadenza, signifying the voice of Solomon, slowly falling into darkness at the end.  This leads into the first theme, played by the orchestra, which is eventually joined by solo cello. Interrupted by a minor orchestral climax and a cadenza-like passage from the solo cello, the music begins to build to the orchestra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first large climax.  After the orchestra quiets to a piano, the cello interrupts with a repeat of the opening cadenza, which leads into the second theme.  While Bloch usually creates his own themes, here we see the use of the Jewish melody Kodosh Attoh (Holy art Thou).  First played by solo oboe,  it is played again by the rest of the woodwinds over the cello cadenza\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme, a technique used often throughout the piece.  While the orchestra builds with the second theme, the cello has outbursts of quintuplets in the upper register, trying again and again to hold back the energy of the orchestra, but failing each time until the orchestra reaches the second climax.  Again the orchestra diminishes, but even softer this time, in which the cello plays a soft, sorrowful development of parts of the first theme over low strings and timpani.  After further development, the cello desends to a low D, from which the orchestra fades into a peaceful dream-like mood, and the cello rises in register, almost carried off by the orchestra, until it falls slowly down to a low G, in which a soft military theme in the orchestra, played earlier in the piece returns, with a lyrical English Horn.  With help of the solo cello, the music builds to its final climax.  After dying down a final time, the solo cello enters with a final repeat of the opening cadenza, ending the piece in a melancholy, tragic mood.  Bloch said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost all my works, however gloomy, end with an optimistic conclusion or at least with hope: This is the only one which ends with an absolute negation.  But the subject required it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVanity of vanities, says the teacher, vanity of vanities!  All is vanity.

Following his studies, Holst earned his living as an orchestral trombonist and, in 1905, was appointed as the Director of Music at the St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s School in Hammersmith. His \u00e2\u0080\u0098St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Suite for string orchestra\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was named for this school. It is during this time that he wrote his most famous work, The Planets (1917), an orchestral suite consisting of seven movements. The London Symphony Orchestra under Albert Coates presented the first performance of the full suite on November 15, 1920 at Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hall, London.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to music critic Herbert Thompson, Holst explained that his motivation for the work and his choice of titles and subtitles were suggested by the astrological significance of the planets and not by classical mythology. It is important to note that because Earth is the point by which astrological observations are made and because Pluto was not discovered until 1930, neither of these planets is represented in the suite. Richard Greene, author of the book \u00e2\u0080\u009cHolst: The Planets\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggests that the order of the movements represent an outward journey into the unknown and that the music is about human character, for which planetary influence is the ruling metaphor. Mr. Greene explains that this outward journey implied by the unique order of the movements is paralleled by a psychological and a philosophical journey as well as to form a conceptual plot: a single character moving deliberately from physical aggression and ambition (Mars) to metaphysical and mystical serenity (Neptune). \r\n\r\nAncient Greek philosophers were aware of astrological knowledge and opinions. Music resulting from astrology is incredibly rare. It was the Greek philosophers who had the idea of the \"Music of the Spheres\"; that planets must have a sound or hum as they floated in space. At this time, only seven planets were known: Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Interestingly, western music evolved with seven-tone scales. Music and astrology come together in this suite dedicated to the seven planets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 however Earth and the Moon are replaced by Uranus and Neptune. Gustav Holst was very familiar with the Greek philosophers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 idea of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMusic of the Spheres\u00e2\u0080\u009d and astrology and mythology. He used his knowledge of these ideas during the composition of The Planets.}\r\n\r\n{The score calls for piccolo, 3 flutes, bass flute, 2 oboes, english horn, bass oboe, 3 clarinets, bass clarinet, 4 bassoons, contra bassoon, 4 trumpets, 6 horns, 3 trombones, bass trombone, tenor tuba, bass tuba, 2 sets of timpani, percussion, 2 harps, celesta, organ, strings and women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chorus.}\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mars: The Bringer of War] is said to be the ruler in Aries and Scorpio. Mars means a hard fight against everything that you find immoral - this force gives one courage and strength. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thorny paths and conflicts are always stimulating to Mars, who thrives on debate and controversy. The personality of the planet is motion, intensity and resolve. Naturally, energy of this type must have a moral motivation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 When good is the goal, the results are magnificent, but undirected; some of the most shocking battles have been the result of the Mars force. Mars was seen by Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contemporaries as a parallel to the horrors of World War I. The terror of warfare confronts us face to face in this bleakest of all tone poems. The movement begins vigorously with strings and percussion sounding a rhythmic sequence in 5/4, (a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccutting edge\u00e2\u0080\u009d meter of its time) forming an ostinato that gives the section its merciless pace. Unresolved harmonies and unrelated chords create clashing dissonances that appropriately depict conflict; tanks pound cities into ruins - bullets fly and bombs descend. It is surprising that Holst completed this piece before the start of World War I - before the invention of the tank, before the use of poisonous gas. The opening theme is transformed into a triumphant declaration before closing with stunning brutality.\r\n\r\n[Venus: The Bringer of Peace] is said to be the ruler in Taurus and Libra and very fruitful in Pisces. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Venus is the planet that rules the factor of love, beauty and the social whirl in our lives. Venus governs according to the position in the horoscope worldly goods; the form of money, jewels, and all the luxuries of life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The calming contrast of Venus is a relief after Mars' fury. Though Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subtitle strays somewhat from the astrologically \u00e2\u0080\u009cVenusian\u00e2\u0080\u009d characteristics of devoted love, beauty and passion, he provides us with a symbolic opposition of war and peace when comparing it to the previous movement. This lyrical tone poem has no brass other than french horns which allows the lush strings to dominate. Peaceful melodies lead to a romantic interlude with harps and celesta that fades to an ethereal ending. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The very picture of beauty - this is the Venus of ancient Rome: a sprite of gardens and flowers, feminine without wiliness or deceit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\r\n \r\n[Mercury: The Winged Messenger] is a fleeting scherzo and is said to be the ruler in Gemini and Virgo. Mercury is an intellectual force that rules common sense and is a symbol of what one thinks and how one expresses thoughts. Mercury governs speed and journeys short and fleet; the ancient Greeks described him as \"The Messenger of the Gods\". Holst crafts astrology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009csymbol of the mind\u00e2\u0080\u009d with quick arpeggio and scale-like passages connecting one instrument to another. Mercury abounds in polyrhythms; some instruments playing in 6/8 while others are in 2/4. The movement has an ethereal, restless quality evoking Mercury as he flits about through this piece, represented primarily by the woodwinds and sounding not unlike a \u00e2\u0080\u0098cosmic butterfly\u00e2\u0080\u0099. He surely belongs in the Garden of Venus that precedes him!\r\n \r\n[Jupiter: The Bringer of Jollity] is said to be the ruler in Sagittarius and also very powerful in Pisces. The planet, called by the ancient Greeks as \"The Greater Fortune\", \u00e2\u0080\u0098represents religious urges, philosophical thoughts, and dreams of vast accomplishments and great ideals. The personality of Jupiter is jovial, expansive, generous and benign.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Perhaps the best-known of the tone-poems, the spirit of this music is very much in keeping with the astrological significance of Jupiter. This Jupiter has a wide smile and a twinkle in his eyes. He invites all of the women to dance, however he does not seem to favor any one of the women more than the others; he is one of those men who adores all women simply because they are women. Jupiter evokes both a sense of fun and, according to Holst, \"the more ceremonial type of rejoicing associated with religious or national festivities.\" Beginning with a spirited tune against swiftly moving strings and woodwinds, the movement quickly brings forth several celebratory themes. Holst set one of the melodies as a separate hymn, \"I vow to thee my country.\" The hymn ends on an unresolved chord that is instantly met by the jolly motifs of the first section, drawing to a brilliant finish.\r\n \r\n[Saturn: The Bringer of Old Age] was Holst's favorite movement. Saturn is known as the \"Old Man of the Zodiac\" and is said to be the ruler of Capricorn. Saturn is considered a teacher and a mentor, though not too soft spoken. Peaceful and deliberate are the words best describing the tone of this piece. A slow, repeated two-note pattern played first by flutes and harps reminds the listener of relentless time. When Saturn arrives, he is not nearly as dreadful as his heavy steps led us to believe. The deliberation is still there, yet what he creates for us is not without its beauty; sparkling snowflakes, changing leaves, calm in recognition of his own mortality - at ease. The inevitable procession leads to a broad climax with clanging bells that suggests a ringing clock or a church chime. Peace is made with time: the movement subsides in calm harmony with the now-distant bell. Its expressions of resolution are enriched by the experiences encountered by the earlier movements. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The unrelenting passage of time admits no exceptions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - all are brought to judgment before the calm ending.\r\n\r\n[Uranus: The Magician] is not the god Uranus of mythology we meet here, but Uranus as the ruler of astrological Aquarius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Greater Mind\" Uranus \u00e2\u0080\u0098suggests connection with advanced planes of thought, gathered from a loftier existence in a planetary system that has not been studied.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Opening with a pretentious four-note figure in the brass, which was labeled by Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter Imogen as \u00e2\u0080\u009can incantation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (a spell), the orchestra in its fullest use in the suite whips itself into a grand march of great eccentricity. There are similarities here with Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice, especially in the use of bassoon and contrabassoon in the opening. Far removed from the earthly properties of the earlier movements, an erratic and clever yet non-aggressive sorcerer is suggested; he clearly has a lot of fun conjuring up his spells. He is a Magician who cannot keep his secrets - this magician is clumsy and accident prone but also a performer who just cannot resist trying once more ... but his whimsical nature has deep wisdom and knowledge of the infinite. On the last try, \u00e2\u0080\u0098he gets it right and we hear the opening of the doorway into eternity\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - everything suddenly drops to an awed hush: the sorcerer has evidently worked a real spell and brought us to the last movement.\r\n\r\n[Neptune: The Mystic] is the eternity that Uranus has revealed to us. Neptune is said to be the ruler of Pisces with a strong influence on Cancer. Neptune represents dreams and visions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it is delicate and subtle; perhaps a little poetic. Instructing the orchestra to {\u00e2\u0080\u009cplay sempre pianissimo throughout - dead tone\u00e2\u0080\u009d}, Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final movement is the most visionary and impressionist of the suite. The abyss opens and we step out into the void. Its sparse orchestration paints a mystical state. We have a sense of floating through empty space, through Neptune's watery depths. Celestial harmonies envelop us and Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final diminuendo brings resolution of fulfillment and serenity. It depicts, as nearly as possible, the remoteness and mystery of this distant blue-green planet. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We hear choirs of angels receding into the distance.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\r\n\r\nIf Pluto had been discovered while The Planets was being written, one wonders what Holst may have done musically with the astrological description of the personality and traits of the distant planet.\r\n \r\n[Pluto:] \u00e2\u0080\u0098Pluto is the planet of regeneration and reform. Pluto governs sex and reproduction. Life under Pluto passes silently from this plane into the unknown. It might be recalled that in Greek mythology, Pluto was the king of the underworld, dark and turgid, but at a special plea of mankind he allowed his wife to visit the earth every year. Her coming was a rebirth of joy. We call it springtime. Pluto removes conditions as well as persons, and starts the tide of rebirth. In matters of reform Pluto is unlike Uranus. The Pluto type of reformation takes the form of penance.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Pluto along with Mars represents Aries and Scorpio.\r\n\r\nThe astrological signs not represented in the suite are linked to the following:          \r\n\r\n[Leo:] Ruler of the Sun \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t          \r\n[The Sun] is the planet of the self, energy and power. \u00e2\u0080\u0098In astrology it symbolizes everything we are trying to become, the center around which all our activity in life revolve. This Planet represents the spirit and what it is that makes the individual unique. Everything in the horoscope ultimately revolves around this singular body. It is the Sun which gives strength to the other Planets, which is why this Planet occupies a key role in Astrology. It is the symbol of strength, wisdom, dignity and generosity.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \r\n\r\n[Cancer:] Ruler of the Moon\r\n\t\t                                  \r\n[The Moon] is the planet of the unconscious mind, habits and emotions. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Since the Moon is closest to Earth it influences us more deeply than any other Planet. The effect is very personal, very intimate. Whereas the Sun gives us our spirit, it's the Moon which gives us our soul. The Moon is goddess-like in that it symbolizes mother and the relationship between woman and child. The moon speaks to the women in one's life and their role as nurturer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\r\n\r\nClassical astrology considered all planets in the study of astrology beginning with the Sun and the Moon; also known as luminaries. \r\n \r\nLiza Grossman, 2005", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 128, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 32, "conductor": [181], "song": 124, "premiere": "d", "note": "John Stuart Ely, III, is the Marimba soloist for this performance.

Some of Creston's most famous works include three symphonies, Fantasy for Trombone and Orchestra, Walt Whitman, Janus, Chthonic Ode, and many others.\r\n\r\nClassified as a Neo-Romantic composer because of his embracing of emotional expressions as a fundamental purpose of music, Creston has a very unique style.  His music is also tonal, in the sense that he chooses not to write his music around a particular key, although you can often pick out certain keys during particular passages.  Creston however objects to the term \u00e2\u0080\u009ctonal\u00e2\u0080\u009d in describing his music, preferring the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cpantonal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy music is not tonal.

The movement is filled with rhythmic ostinati i.e., repeated patterns. They are presented throughout the whole movement. \r\n\r\nServing as a tranquil transition to the first movement is [CALM].  Expressive playing from the winds and strings captivates a unique blend with the marimba in this movement. Featuring four-mallet choral work, the marimba plays relaxing chords while expressive runs in the middle are prominent before finally fading to an end.   \r\n\r\nThe third movement, [LIVELY], begins with an animated dance in 6/8. Idiomatic scales and arpeggios are strung throughout the movement. A sudden switch to 2/4 intersects the opening two themes before the orchestra sets up the ending. Returning back to the beginning statement of the movement, the intensity is driven towards the end by the marimba before the dramatic ending.   \r\n\r\nRuth Stuber premiered the concerto in 1940 with conductor Frederique Petrides and her Orchestrette Classique women's orchestra at Carnegie Hall.  It has always been one of my favorites due to its intriguing wind and string parts that correspond beautifully with the solo marimba part.

Tan Dun's manuscript of The Map was acquired recently by Carnegie Hall for its Composers Gallery in New York.\r\n\r\nThe score calls for 2 flutes, 2 piccolos, 2 oboes,2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 2 trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, percussion, harp, strings, solo cello and children's chorus.}\r\n\r\nCommissioned by the Hong Kong government in 1996 to celebrate the reunification of Hong Kong with China on July 1, 1997, Tan Dun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 70-minute {Heaven Earth Mankind -Symphony 1997} features the bianzhong in a dramatic montage that captures the panorama of human history and the longings of our spirit. Like the city of Hong Kong itself, Symphony 1997 joins the cultures of East and West. It reflects the Chinese aesthetic of using celebratory music as a vehicle for spiritual contemplation, while simultaneously featuring lush Romantic harmonies and sweeping lines characteristic of Western music. Tan Dun conspicuously adapts African rhythms, as well as melodies well known to audiences in the East (an aria from the Cantonese opera The Flower of the Emperor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daughter), the West (Beethoven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cOde to Joy\u00e2\u0080\u009d), and around the world (\u00e2\u0080\u009cJasmine Flower,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a revered Chinese folksong further immortalized in Puccini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s {Turandot}). The cello employs Eastern performing techniques. Taoist philosophy colors the Symphony through its tripartite division into spheres of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind; and a plethora of yin/yang contrasts: the eternal and the ephemeral; the visible and the hidden; the new and the old. A hymn to universal freedom and peace, and a spiritual descendent of Beethoven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ninth Symphony, Tan Dun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Symphony 1997 envisions a new world \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one in which the arrogance of isolationism, colonialism, and imperialism has finally yielded to a global community. \r\n\r\nIn the exuberant [Dragon Dance], large, colorful paper serpents snake through crowded streets at Chinese New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; the sensuous [Phoenix], with flowing melodies and harp cascades, presents the yin to Dragon Dance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vigorous yang. Together the heaven-dwelling, life-giving dragon (a symbol of the Emperor) and the Phoenix bird (his Empress) symbolize good luck. In Jubilation, strands of Beethoven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s {Ode to Joy} and a raucous Chinese folksong gradually blend into a collage of celebratory songs and traditions. The work blossoms with joyous melodies, although wartime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drums are not yet for in the past; children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voices, optimistic but world wise, look to the future. Written in the spirit of Li Po and recalling Schiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s text to {Ode to Joy,} Tan Dun's culminating anthem seeks the reunification of nature and soul in an enduring, harmonious world order. The chorus uses syllables of yearning and praying (\u00e2\u0080\u009cWu\u00e2\u0080\u009d), primitive cries of exertion (\u00e2\u0080\u009cHei ho hei\u00e2\u0080\u009d), joy (\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa\u00e2\u0080\u009d): these empty words, seemingly meaningless, express the fullness of life. \r\n\r\n{Heaven, Earth, and all Mankind,\r\nListen\r\nThe bells which no longer sound \u00e2\u0080\u009cfarewell\u00e2\u0080\u009d knock at spring\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door,\r\nThe wind of winter past blows the bugle of jubilation,\r\nThe drum, no longer announcing war, plays with everlasting harmony,\r\nThe mother, no longer crying, sings of joyous peace.\r\nAh!

His successful opera, Lady Macbeth was banned after Stalin saw it in 1936 and was offended by its veiled criticism of the Communist regime. This was no small matter; most who drew the dictator's wrath died soon after in a labor camp. Shostakovich was lucky, perhaps because the young composer had already achieved some international recognition, but the attacks in Pravda forced him to keep a packed suitcase beside his bed in case he was arrested in the night.\r\n\r\nIn such an atmosphere, and with a wife and two young children to worry about, it was only natural that Shostakovich would try to please the authorities. And he did, at least on the surface: the Fifth Symphony's subtitle is \u0093A Soviet Artist's Practical Creative Reply to Just Criticism.\u0094\r\n\r\nThe first movement is tragic, and its climax quite terrifying. A funeral march rhythm, played at double speed, develops into a threatening march of full brass and timpani, with strings and winds in disarray beneath. The peak, reached with most instruments playing near the top of their range, is followed by a powerful and near-unison descent, the loudest moment in the symphony, which then drops in dynamic to the soft and now slow funeral march. The movement ends with a solo Celeste, a sad and beautiful sound.\r\n\r\nThe second is a bold scherzo version of a Minuet that opens with tumultuous bass and cello. A solo violin and flute emerge, with pizzicato accompaniment from the strings, but it can all sound very insincere, even mocking. Depending on the interpretation, the movement can sound anything from delightful to callous.\r\n\r\nThe third, a Largo, is probably the most beautiful piece of music Shostakovich had written up to this point in his career. Brass and percussion are entirely absent, giving the movement a much more introverted and personal feel. It ranges in mood from early calm detachment, with soft strings and occasional flute and clarinet, to a terrible and incredibly powerful outpouring of grief at the climax, where the full strings together produce a sound as overwhelming as the brass chorales of the first movement. There are some very emotional solos, particularly for the cello section. The movement closes with the same sadness and serenity as the first.\r\n\r\nThe final movement is a remarkable contrast to the eloquence of the Largo. The movement has the surface optimism required to pacify the regime. \r\nIt is bombastic and exaggerated and perhaps considered arrogant and brutish by the end. There are some beautiful sections of peace, with solo strings and harp providing calm and reflection, but these are quickly snatched away, usually with slightly menacing snare drum. The conclusion is optimistic, but that does not save it from being threatening - it is the optimism of someone who really shouldn't be winning.\r\n\r\nHowever, this final movement, often criticized for sounding shrill, is declared in Testimony to be a parody of shrillness, representing \"forced rejoicing\". \r\n\r\nAnd of the finale, Shostakovich wrote in his memoirs (smuggled out of Russia after the composer's death):\r\n\r\n{\u0093What exultation could there be? I think it is clear to everyone what happens in the Fifth. The rejoicing is forced, created under threat... It's as if someone were beating you with a stick and saying \u0093Your business is rejoicing, your business is rejoicing,'' and you rise, shaky, and go marching off, muttering, \u0093Our business is rejoicing, our business is rejoicing.'' What kind of apotheosis is that? You have to be a complete oaf not to hear that.\u0094}\r\n\r\nThis is symbolized by the repeated \u0091A\u0092 at the end of the final movement in the violin and upper woodwind sections. It includes a quotation from the composer's song \"Rebirth\", accompanying the words \"A barbarian painter\" who \"blackens the genius's painting\". In the song, the barbarian's paint falls away and the original painting is reborn. It has been suggested that the barbarian and the genius are Stalin and Shostakovich respectively. The work is largely somber despite the composer's official claim that he wished to write a positive work.\r\n\r\nThroughout history, artists have thumbed their noses at authorities who were too dense to see through their parody and satire, and Shostakovich was no different. \r\n\r\nThe Fifth Symphony was very successful. The Russian government was pleased that the rebel had knuckled under, while the Russian people in the street saw the truth behind the facade. Western listeners took the work at face value and were overwhelmed by its grandeur and beauty. The symphony has become Shostakovich's most popular work, and the relatively recent revelation of its true meaning can only enhance our enjoyment of this testament to one persons struggle to express his people's anguish under a brutal tyrant.\r\n\r\n- Liza Grossman", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 141, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 35, "conductor": [181], "song": 137, "premiere": "d", "note": "{Completed in 1954, Festive Overture is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 3 oboes, 3 clarinets, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, triangle, tamburo, snare drum, bass drum, strings.}\r\n\r\nThe story behind the creation of the Festive Overture is one of those fantastic tales that tells the true nature of a composer\u0092s genius, leaving all of us shaking our heads in wonder. \r\n\r\nShostakovich received the commission for this work literally days before the intended concert - a gathering at the Bolshoy Theatre in November 1954, celebrating the 37th anniversary of the 1917 October Revolution. Vasili Nebol'sin, a conductor at the Bolshoy Theatre, found himself in the potentially disastrous position of not having a celebratory work to open this very important concert. He approached Shostakovich hoping the composer would be willing to help. When Shostakovich agreed to write the opening piece, people transported the individual sheets of manuscript (still wet with ink) to the theatre where copyists would create the orchestral parts.\r\n\r\nLev Nikolayevich Lebedinsky, a musicologist and friend of Shostakovich, was at the composer's apartment when this exceptional commission arrived: \r\n\r\n{\u0093The speed with which he wrote was truly astounding. Moreover, when he wrote light music he was able to talk, make jokes and compose simultaneously, like the legendary Mozart. He laughed and chuckled, and in the meanwhile work was under way and the music was being written down. Dmitri with his strange, unpredictable, almost schizophrenic character, had the notion that I brought him good fortune, although to my knowledge I never brought him any particular luck. He said, `Lev Nikolayevich, sit down here beside me and I'll write the overture in no time at all.' Then he started composing. The speed with which he wrote was truly astounding.\u0094}\r\n\r\nWithin just two days the completed overture was in rehearsal. \r\n\r\nThere is not a trace of urgency or sloppiness in the vibrant Festive Overture. Shostakovich composed at a fast pace, writing with phenomenal ability. We will never know if he used musical ideas which were already swimming around in his head or whether the piece was an immediate genius of inspiration. It is fun to think of Shostakovich \u0093laughing and chuckling\u0094 as he composed, considering the composer\u0092s good humor driving this energetic, truly festive work.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Shostakovich, who had shaky nerves, conducted an orchestra only once, at a concert organized by his friend Mstislav Rostropovich in 1962. Shostakovich opened the concert with his Festive Overture.\r\n\r\n- Liza Grossman", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 142, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 35, "conductor": [181], "song": 138, "premiere": "a", "note": "{Completed in September 2006, Power Chords is scored for piccolo, 3 flutes, 3 oboes, 3 clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, vibraphone, chimes, vibraslap, snare drum, glockenspiel, 4 triangles, cymbals, small bass drum, suspended cymbal, harp, strings, solo string quartet.}\r\n\r\n\r\n[Power Chords] is a concerto for string quartet.  My challenge in writing the piece was to combine two separate, self-contained ensembles: the string quartet, which excels at detail and delicacy; and the orchestra, which\u0097trading nimbleness for color and power\u0097requires the composer to paint with a big brush.  I used various strategies to synthesize these two groups: sometimes (as in movement 2), the orchestra accompanies while the quartet plays a melody, as a traditional soloist would; while at other times (like the latter part of movement 1) the quartet provides a complex rhythmic background, and the orchestra adds melodic material.  The final movement offers a reconciliation of sorts: by the end, the soloists have been incorporated into the main string sections, and delicacy has given way to a joyous free-for-all.\r\n\r\n{Broken Record} imagines an old phonograph playing some colorful popular music\u0097big band jazz, perhaps.  The record player doesn\u0092t work very well, however, and we hear the music through a haze of skips, pops, and repeats.  (Is that \u0093Oh when the saints \u0085\u0094 in the winds?)  After a brash orchestral introduction, the soloists enter with a typical \u0093concertoish\u0094 bravura passage.  The quartet plays a series of swaggering solo statements before getting stuck on a repetitive figure; this leads to a long crescendo and the return of the opening melody.  The last main section of the movement settles into D major and reinterprets the opening material.  The movement ends with a completely unmotivated turn to E major, reminiscent of the sudden \u0093up by step\u0094 modulations in popular music.\r\n\r\n{Settlement} is meant to evoke the idea of \u0093settling down\u0094\u0097but it also brings to my mind the image of a desolate, frontier landscape.  The music starts softly, works itself into a moderate frenzy, then spends the rest of its time calming itself back down.  The solo quartet refuses to play along, however, and emerges to perform a kind of resigned cadenza.\r\n\r\nThe title of the third movement\u0097{Louis Armstrong, in Heaven, Performs a Funeral March for Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti}\u0097pretty much says it all.  (For those of you who don\u0092t know, Armstrong was the first great jazz soloist, while Ligeti was the last great avant-garde composer\u0097a master of atmospheric dissonance who managed to make atonality sound good.

He launched his music career in July of 1941 as second trumpet with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. By the end of the 1940s, Arnold's main focus was composition. Many of his pieces were written specifically for the friends he made in the LPO. He was knighted in 1993 for his service to music. As a composer, Arnold's goals were \"to give his performers music as ingratiating as possible to perform, to paint their portrait in sound, and to entertain and challenge us who are listeners.\" Arnold died on September 26, 2006. \r\n  \r\nArnold's Horn Concerto No. 1 was written for Charles Gregory, the first horn of the LPO. It was performed by the LPO at the Royal Opera House on December 8, 1946 (exactly 60 years and 1 day ago!). This three movement concerto is the most expansive of Arnold's concertos, lasting nearly 25 minutes. Throughout the first movement, which will be performed tonight, the soloist is given many opportunities to highlight the extensive range and capabilities of the French Horn; yet Arnold never forgot to give the soloist a chance to rest! \r\n\r\n-Carrie Coverdale", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 144, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 36, "conductor": [181], "song": 140, "premiere": "d", "note": "Hoyt Curtin (1922-2000) first began writing music for cartoons for the UPA studios, including the Academy Award-winning short When Magoo Flew (1955).

During a stay in this beautiful location I was taken by my friends to visit a deserted village in ruins. It actually looked about 200 years old but in actual fact was originally a commune of hippies during the '60s. During this experience I took my manuscript paper to this village and superimposed my experience over the song \"Black Dog.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n[Going to California]\r\n\r\nHave checked in to the Magic Hotel.  Pacific/Hawaiian glissando\u0092s, grilled Mahi-Mahi with a bottle of Robert Mondavi Fume Blanc.  Pink California grapefruits, Anaheim peppers, Hollywood stars, bars and dreams.\r\n\r\nThrough Silicon Valley at 100 mph, then we find ourselves in Olivera St. with the Muoz family.  Quesadilla, Bohemia beer, lashings of Cholulla hot sauce and a sprinkling of Mexican trumpets in 3rds.  Optimism, opportunity, finale, then silence.\r\n\r\nFlute and strings describe my sadness at the reintroduction of the death penalty in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Daughter of England] ({Sophia})\r\n\r\nI wrote the entirety of the score in the three days directly after the shocking announcement that HRH Dinana, Princess of Wales, had been killed in a car accident in Paris. The news profoundly affected me on many different levels. She was the first member of the Royal Family who actively reached out to the ordinary people of Great Britain. The genuine outpouring of grief affected everyone. Then there ws another connection, namely that her family (the Shand-Kydde family) took pity on me while I was studying orchestration and kindly provided me with a beautiful house in Nottinghill Gate (36 Portabello Road) where I could study rent-free. \r\nIn context to the libretto, I wanted to emphasise Princess Diana's legacy of her charitable works. She went out and kissed and embraced AIDS patients and landmine casualties, she was inspired by Mother Theresa and drew attention to the plight of the homeless, reinforced by her numerous charitable foundations. Thus I have tried to distill the very best of her into my text. \r\nOne of the more obscure factors I took into consideration with the libretto was Diana's remarkable geneology, which can be traced back to the dawn of civilisation. Once I discovered that the Princess of Wales was of Stuart decent, I consulted the world-renowned geneologist Sir Laurence Gardner, who is the official Jacobite histographer attache\u00e9d to the Royal House of Stuart and President of the European Council of Princess, to enlighten me. I was surprised to discover Diana's line could be traced back to the early French King Dagobert II, whose subsequent lineage is traced to the Holy Land and Sumer. Thus I list her entire family tree on the female side in chronological order. In the latter part of the work I wanted to crystallise her compassionate deeds in order to merge her immortal image with her acts of kindness, represented by the repitition of the Greek word 'Sophia', which simply means 'wisdom'. \r\nThe score was on my shelf gathering dust for almost a decade, as it was never my intention to capitalise or exploit her memory in any form. The work premiered by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra the Royal Albert Hall May 2006 to standing ovation. However, this was the shortened version until tonight.\r\n \r\n\r\n[The Battle of Evermore] ({Belfast})\r\n\r\nIrish pipes represent the emerald green, piccolo symbolizes the orange.  Des Copeland, who introduced me to the music of Sean O\u0092Reda, passed away the night we recorded this.  He is now having a drink with Terry Cox and they are both taking the piss out of me!  White pudding for breakfast before leaving the war zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[When the Levee Breaks] ({Will Work For Food})\r\n\r\nI am looking out of a Chicago caf\u00e9 at an African-American holding a placard with the words I WILL WORK FOR FOOD.  Score in the manner of a spiritual.  Re-work the second development section to capture a psychotic Baptist vibe in semi-quavers (160 BPM).  The pain of struggle obliterated by revelation.  Refer to Martin Luther King\u0092s famous oratory.  How do we honor Bonham with orchestral percussion?  Faith!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Whole Lotta Love] ({Grozny})\r\n\r\nWhen I approached the arrangement of \"Whole Lotta Love,\" I decided not to take the obvious route. Before I commenced the work, I was studying the conflict in Chechnya and was profoundly moved. Again I superimposed my reflections over the original riff of \"Whole Lotta Love.\" I let my inspiration run wild and in the end finished a fourteen-minute epic that was never used on the original record, hence this exciting premiere tonight.\r\n \r\n\r\n[All Of My Love] ({In the Library at Windsor})\r\n\r\nIn the library at Windsor.  Memories of Sally Ann and Terry (who knew of my arcane curiosity).  I know of only one library that would exceed in magnificence to the collection at Windsor and this would be found in the Vatican.  After this experience I realized that knowledge pales in significance to the heart.  The dead live by love.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Friends]\r\n\r\nWe are in the regency town of Cheltenham, the birth place of Gustav Holst, Brian Jones and the Black Jester.  Its relevance to Friends\u009d becomes apparent when I realized that John Paul Jones appears to have adapted the original mellotron/string part from Mars in Holst\u0092s Planet Suite.  Everything turns full circle as one of the original composers suddenly becomes the arranger, thus we hand this arrangement (with full honors) back to the spirit of Holst on a platter.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Holst was a member of the Institute of Oriental Studies in London so all roads lead to home.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Stairway to Heaven] ({Sketch in NZ feeling homesick})\r\n\r\nInitially I was reluctant to score this piece as we all know it is perhaps the most covered song after Sinatra\u0092s My Way\u009d.  It wasn\u0092t until I actually listened to all the symphonic abortions of this sacred Celtic anthem that I felt a sense of authority to complete the mother of all Stairways.  That profound themes such as death and enlightenment could be perfectly expressed in one song through both lyric and melody, is testament to the genius of Robert Plant.  Check out the penultimate version.  No retro zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Kashmir]\r\nThe time is 4:00 a.m. and we are in Cairo, Egypt at the end of Haj.  Cattle line the street waiting slaughter.  Later today I work at the Hany Mehanna studio but not before everyone is rounded up to witness sunrise at the Great Pyramid on horseback (which is the introduction to this work).\r\n\r\nWe are here bathing in the shimmering light.  One can almost see the praises rising, the triumph of spirit over matter, the mastery of anti-gravity, a universe expressed in pure mathematics, sacred geometry and masonry that defies all rationality.\r\n\r\nThe time is now 10,700 BC.  Brother Youth takes our experience into 3D.  Our pilgrimage has begun.  Arabic percussion, transmute Bonham into orchestral percussion.

This cello concerto employs a four-note theme that functions as the cornerstone of the first movement\u0092s unrelenting development. The opening movement of the concerto is one of his most celebrated creations, one that makes use of not only the instrumental color of the accompanying woodwinds but also the prominently featured solo parts for clarinet and horn. Shostakovich, in his orchestration, included only one brass instrument: one horn, to which he assigned a significant role in segments of the piece. In some passages of the first movement, the horn appears to be stoking the thematic fire stated by the cello; while during others it is the cello's companion, promptly reaffirming its energy. The repetitive crying themes presented by the cello are reminders of Stalin\u0092s authoritative vice grip on his people.

The giant ape has been such a popular character that there have not only been sequels, but two complete remakes (one in 1976, directed by John Guillermin, and another in 2005, directed by Peter Jackson), as well as appearances in Japanese sci-fi cinema (beginning with King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)). The score for the original King Kong was written by arguably the first important film composer of the sound era, Max Steiner. A child prodigy as a composer\u0097he had lessons from Brahms and Mahler\u0097Steiner first made a name for himself as a composer of operetta. His first work in Hollywood was for the film Rio Rita (1929). His ability to integrate his music with the action on screen brought him acclaim as a composer, especially in the early 1930s, when composers and studios alike were still trying to figure out exactly what role music should play in the movies. He would go on to score literally hundreds of films; a sampling of his scores include those for The Informer (1936), Dark Victory (1939), Gone With the Wind (1939),  Now, Voyager (1942), Casablanca (1942), The Big Sleep (1946), Life With Father (1947), and The Caine Mutiny (1954).\r\n\r\nDaniel Goldmark, 2008", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 166, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 39, "conductor": [181], "song": 162, "premiere": "d", "note": "Spider-Man (2002)\r\nWhile director Sam Raimi\u0092s franchise of Spider-Man films began in 2002, the character of Spider-Man is almost a half-century old.

Bernard Herrmann's film scores, in particluar those written after the mid-1950's, are characterized by great economy of means. Ostinato patterns, austerely simple harmonic structures and unorthodox orchestration are notable features of his style. He chose to score PSYCHO for strings alone in an attempt to reflect in music the \"Black-and White\" image of the film.\r\n\r\nHerrmann compiled PSYCHO Suite from the manuscript of the film score. No recomposition was done; the material employed in the suite comes directly from the film score. He selected 11 of the 40 pieces he wrote for the film, grouping them into three sections.\r\n\r\nThe first section comes from the first half of the film, where marion Crane (Janet Leigh) absconds with $40,000 from her job at a bank. She loses her way in a rainstorm and comes to rest at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). The second section describes Marions murder by Norman's mother, and Norman's attmept to protect his mother by burying the body in the swamp behind the motel. The third section describes the murder of Arbogast (Martin Baksam), a private detective hired to find Marion, and the denouement, where norman is revealed as a homicidal psychopath.\r\n\r\nUnknown, 1960\r\n\r\nPyscho (1960)\r\nThe music for the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock\u0092s film Psycho (1960) usually tops people\u0092s list of the scariest music ever written. Few people know that Hitchcock actually considered running the scene with no music whatsoever. Fortunately for us, the director took the advice of his composer, Bernard Herrmann, with whom he had already collaborated on the scores for three films, including Vertigo (1958). While most films in Hollywood were being produced in color by 1960, Hitchcock made the decision to shoot in black and white for several reasons (it was more economical, the gore would be less intense, and it made the film stand out starkly against other films being produced at the time). Herrmann therefore chose to restrain his own color palette as a composer by using only a string orchestra for the entire score. Rather than limiting Herrmann\u0092s ability to write, the string-only approach actually forced the composer to explore all the possibilities the string orchestra could offer him; the resulting score goes through every emotion imaginable, including the rhythmic drive of the opening titles, the terrifying screeches of the shower scene, and the sweetly suspenseful melody of the closing scene.\r\n\r\nDaniel Goldmark, 2008", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 170, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 39, "conductor": [181], "song": 166, "premiere": "d", "note": "[The Royal Tenenbaums]\r\n\r\n[111 Archer Avenue] \r\nWes Andersons movies can be a little bit like a high school play turned into a movie and this was sort of the magical puff of theatrical smoke at the beginning of the film.

He is best known for his opera Nixon in China (1985\u009687), recounting Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. His choral piece On the Transmigration of Souls (2002), commemorating the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks, won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2003. Adams is usually categorized as minimalist or post-minimalist. While he employs minimalist techniques, such as repeating patterns, he is not a strict follower of the movement. Adams was born a generation after Steve Reich and Philip Glass, and his writing is more developmental and directionalized, containing climaxes and other elements of Romanticism.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman Dances was an \"out-take\" of Act III of Nixon in China. Neither an \"excerpt\" nor a \"fantasy on themes from,\" it was in fact a kind of warmup for embraking on the creation of the full opera. At the time, 1985, I was obliged to fulfill a long-delayed commission for the Milwaukee Symphony, but having already seen the scenario to Act III of Nixon in China, I couldn\u0092t wait to begin work on that piece. So The Chairman Dances began as a \"foxtrot\" for Chairman Mao and his bride, Chiang Ch\u0092ing, the fabled \"Madame Mao,\" firebrand, revolutionary executioner, architect of China\u0092s calamitous Cultural Revolution, and (a fact not universally realized) a former Shanghai movie actress. In the surreal final scene of the opera, she interrupts the tired formalities of a state banquet, disrupts the slow moving protocol and invites the Chairman, who is present only as a gigantic forty-foot portrait on the wall, to \"come down, old man, and dance.\" The music takes full cognizance of her past as a movie actress. Themes, sometimes slinky and sentimental, at other times bravura and bounding, ride above in bustling fabric of energized motives. Some of these themes make a dreamy reappearance in Act III of the actual opera, en revenant, as both the Nixons and Maos reminisce over their distant pasts. A scenario by Peter Sellars and Alice Goodman, somewhat altered from the final one in Nixon in China, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Chiang Ch\u0092ing, a.k.a. Madame Mao, has gate crashed the Presidential Banquet. She is first seen standing where she is most in the way of the waiters. After a few minutes, she brings out a box of paper lanterns and hangs them around the hall, then strips down to a cheongsam, skin-tight from neck to ankle and slit up the hip. She signals the orchestra to play and begins dancing by herself. Mao is becoming excited. He steps down from his portrait on the wall, and they begin to foxtrot together.

While the idea is not new, I believe that there is still a great deal yet to explore within this musical combination.

Kevin mentioned that he had started a group called Electric Kompany made up of instruments found in a conventional rock band, but one that solely performed music written for it by contemporary composers. The possibility of writing a piece for that sort of ensemble intrigued me, especially the prospect of placing it within an orchestral texture, and the invitation from Liza seemed to be the perfect opportunity to explore this idea.

The first, third, and fifth movements set forth the main musical material, while the second and fourth movements act as short interludes.

Walton accepted the challenge and wrote his only viola concerto, which today is one of his most revered works. When Walton gave the concerto to Tetris he refused to perform the work and returned the music due to the compositions \"modernist excesses\". Luckily, Paul Hindemith, famous for modern contemporary music in his own right (and a violist), took the challenge of premiering the concerto.

Icons can be people, places, or things: Elvis Presley, James Cagney, Jackie O, Liberace, Barbie dolls, Motown, pink flamingo lawn ornaments, Route 66.

The title, Tambor, is the Spanish word for \"drum.\" Tower is familiar with that language, having grown up in South America, where her father worked as a mining engineer, and possibly the prominence and versatility of percussion instruments in Latin American music were influential recollections in her creation of this work, in which she assigns a major role to that section of the orchestra. She has kindly provided the following note of her own:\r\n\r\n\"This 15\u00b7minute work features the percussion section, whose five members (the timpanist and four others) essentially have three functions inside the orchestra:\r\n\r\n1. to 'eyeline,' or underscore the different timbres and rhythms of other parts of the orchestra;\r\n2. to 'counterpoint' other parts of the orchestra.; and\r\n3. to act as soloists in several minor and major cadenzas throughout the work.\r\n\r\nWhat happened while I was writing this piece was that the strong role of the percussion began to influence the behavior of the rest of the orchestra to the point that the other instruments began to act more and more like a percussion section themselves.

Psyche, a beautiful mortal, is, in fact, too beautiful for the goddess Aphrodite, who sends her son Eros to punish her. Instead, Eros falls in love with Psyche and takes her away to his palace where she, although blindfolded (for mortals aren\u0092t allowed to see gods), falls in love with him.  Mislead by her jealous sisters, Psyche makes the mistake of not trusting her young loving heart and tries to see Eros, taking off her blindfold as she leans over him with a candle light. The dripping wax accidentally burns his skin and awakes him \u0096 the wound hurts him less than her betrayal, and in horrible pain, he flees. Aphrodite punishes this transgression by sending Psyche to hell, where she is forced to tortuous tasks. Against all odds, Eros and Psyche hold their love true, and as he forgives her, and she is patient and brave and conquers all the tasks, Zeus intervenes and helps the lovers find each other, as he gives Psyche a potion that will make her immortal. Unlike most mythological stories of love versus fear, it is love that prevails here. This love is represented in the piece by the pitch Ab (pitch class 8), the sum of both Eros (pitch B, 11) and Psyche (pitch A, 9). The pitches of fear, a tritone away from the pitches of love, are represented by D, Eb and F, which we hear throughout the work in the form of almost distant, yet very present high chords that fill the air with a sense of uneasiness. These six pitches battle for supremacy throughout the entire work. In the final bars of the piece, we hear both Eros and Psyche\u0092s themes together for the first and only time in the piece, sustained by Ab, the pitch of love, which ends the piece, quietly and almost unresolved: for passion and love, even after conquering fear, remains subject to the uncertainties of life.

It was premiered that year in Leningrad by the Beethoven Quartet.\r\n\r\nThe piece was written shortly after two traumatic events: the composer's diagnosis with polio, and his joining the Communist Party reluctantly. According to the score, it is dedicated \"to the victims of fascism and war\"; his son, Maxim, interprets this as a reference to the victims of all totalitarianism, while his daughter Galina says that he dedicated it to himself, and that the published dedication was imposed by the Russian authorities. Shostakovich's friend, Lev Lebedinsky, said that Shostakovich thought of the work as his epitaph and that he planned to commit suicide around this time. The work was written in Dresden, where Shostakovich was to write music for the film Five Days, Five Nights, a joint project by Soviet and East German filmmakers about Bombing of Dresden in World War II. The quartet, extremely compact and focused, is in five interconnected movements and lasts twenty minutes:\r\nLargo; Allegro molto; Allegretto; Largo; Largo\r\n\r\nThe first movement opens with the DSCH motif which was Shostakovich's musical signature. This slow, extremely sad theme can also be heard in his Cello Concerto No. 1, Symphony No. 10, Violin Concerto No. 1, Symphony No. 15, and Piano Sonata No. 2. The motif is used in every movement of this quartet, and is the basis of the faster theme of the third movement.\r\nThe work is filled with quotes of other pieces by Shostakovich: the first movement quotes his Symphony No. 1 and Symphony No. 5; the second movement uses a Jewish theme first used by Shostakovich in his Piano Trio No. 2; the third movement quotes the Cello Concerto No. 1; and the fourth movement quotes the 19th century revolutionary song \"Tormented by Grievous Bondage\" and the aria \"Seryozha, my love\" from Shostakovich's opera, Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District.\r\n~ Wikipedia", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 275, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 47, "conductor": [181], "song": 270, "premiere": "d", "note": "William Alwyn (1905-1985) was born in Northampton, England. After showing great promise on the flute and piccolo, he entered the Royal Academy of Music in London to study flute performance and composition. He had long and distinguished careers in both fields, serving as a flautist in the London Symphony Orchestra for a time and serving as the professor of composition at the Royal Academy from 1926-1955. Although remembered mostly for his large and varied output of orchestral works, chamber works, and concerti for several individual and groups of instruments, he also wrote over 200 film scores, including Odd Man Out, Fires Were Started, The Fallen Idol, and Crimson Pirate. In addition to composing and performing, he was also a prolific painter, sculptor, and poet. He died in Southwold, Suffolk.\r\nEvelyn Rothwell premiered Concerto for Oboe, Strings and Harp on August 12th, 1949. She was the future wife of conductor John Barbirolli, who later championed many of Alwyn's symphonic works. The Concerto is in two movements, the first being a slow pastorale; the second, a dance-like movement reminiscent of the countryside Alwyn had to desert during World War II. The second movement opens with a three-against-two motion in the strings, a rhythmic pattern seen throughout the work, leading to the solo oboe declaring one of the short themes Alwyn frequently returns to and develops throughout the first half of the movement. After several exchanges between the solo oboe and the strings, the work gradually slows down through the reintroduction of material from the first movement, growing to a climatic fanfare-like finish.\r\n\r\n`Joshua Lauretig, soloist.", "arranger": [], "guest_artist": []}}, {"pk": 276, "model": "repertoire.performedsong", "fields": {"soloist": [], "concert": 47, "conductor": [181], "song": 271, "premiere": "a", "note": "[PROJECT Trio] is a passionate, high-energy chamber music ensemble comprised of three virtuosic composer/performers from Brooklyn, NY.

Flutist Carol Wincenc had known Lukas Foss since her youth in the 1960\u0092s, when he was music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic. When she asked him to write a flute concerto for her in 1985, he was faced with the problem confronted by every composer in this genre: how to create orchestral texture that would not overwhelm the solo instrument.

One such phrase was \"Liquid Melancholy\" - when referring to sleep-inducing medication. I knew right then that if I ever had the opportunity to use that as a title, I would jump on it.\r\n\r\nThat opportunity came just a few months later, when Liza Grossman, director of the Contemporary Youth Orchestra in Cleveland, asked to commission me to write a new clarinet concerto for Daniel Gilbert. A consortium of three ensembles was quickly formed, including Liza/CYO, the Midwest Young Artists (John Bruce Yeh, soloist, and Allan Dennis, conductor) and the Portland Youth Philharmonic (David Shiffrin, soloist and David Hattner, conductor). This project excited me on multiple levels: I had never written a major work for the clarinet, and everyone for whom I was writing was terrific friends and wonderful musicians (Liza Grossman, David Hattner and I going back to high school days at the Interlochen Arts Academy).\r\n\r\nI've always been fascinated by the clarinet's ability to play such smooth and fluid lines, at all dynamic levels. This \"liquidity\" is something I wanted to highlight in this concerto. This is most evident in the 1st movement, when the clarinet is set against angular lines, first introduced by the solo cello. For the melancholy aspect, I wanted to write some searching music: some deeply personal and intimate music, a chance for the soloist and audience to relate and reflect upon what I put out there. This is the 2nd movement. The third and fourth movements are played without break - an accompanied cadenza followed by a wispy and light final scherzo.\r\n\r\nThe concerto is roughly 16 minutes, and is scored for Solo Clarinet + 2 Flutes, Piccolo, 2 Oboes, English Horn, 2 Bb Clarinets, Bass Clarinet, 2 Bassoons 4 Horns, 2 C Trumpets, 2 Trombones, Bass Trombone, Tuba, Timpani, 4 percussionists, Harp and Strings.\r\n\r\nIt is with great pleasure that I dedicate this work to the consortium of three orchestras/soloists for their belief in commissioning new music, and to Liza Grossman and Daniel Gilbert, for initiating the idea and premiering the work.\r\n~ James M.

No fewer than eighteen composers immediately responded with fanfares for different combinations of instruments...\"\r\n     Ten of the fanfares were written for the combination of brass and percussion, and were published in a single volume, with Copland's as the first. Little needs to be said about the work itself, which makes as strong an impression today as it must have when it was first heard against the dark background of America's entrance into World War II.\r\n     It is interesting to note the other nine fanfares in the volume: Fanfare for the Forces of our Latin American Allies (Henry Cowell), Fanfare for Paratroopers (Paul Creston), Fanfare for the Medical Corps (Anis Fuleihan), Fanfare for the Merchant Marine (Eugene Goosens), Fanfare for the Signal Corps (Howard Hansen), Fanfare for the Fighting French (Walter Piston), Fanfare for Russia (Deems Taylor), Fanfare for France (Virgil Thomson), and Fanfare for Airmen (Bernard Wagenaar).

Due to the widespread interest in the performing arts across the nation, several \"Big Apples\" have emerged and allowed many young musicians and artists to share their talents with the world. Although these towns are not New York City, they are truly \"Chasing Manhattan\".\r\n    Chasing Manhattan presents a multitude of themes and motives that are developed at varied harmonic angles throughout the composition. Quartal and quintal harmonies, imitative counterpoint, and some twelve tone techniques provide a unique layered effect for much of the piece.

His father was a postal clerk, and his mother a church organist. It was his mother that provided him with his first musical training. He studied double bass with a member of The Boston Symphony and attended Harvard where he studied theory and composition with Walter Piston.\r\n     In 1935, Anderson decided to give music as a career a try. He obtained a job as one of the arrangers for the famous Boston Pops Orchestra. His first big job was to make a medley of Harvard tunes for Harvard night at the Pops. \"Harvard Fantasy\" was the result, and conductor Arthur Fiedler called Anderson out to conduct it! Fiedler recognized Anderson's ability to handle orchestral instruments and encouraged him to do more composing. Thus began the long association between Fiedler and Anderson which spawned so many delightful compositions.\r\n     Constantly on the alert for ideas, Anderson found inspiration in unusual places and brought his meticulous craftsmanship to the lightest of novelties. His well known piece, \"The Syncopated Clock\", was the theme song for an evening program on CBS called \"The Late Show\".\r\n     \"[Bugler's Holiday]\" shows off a section of three trumpets.

Created by George Herriman (1880-1944), the main characters\u0097Krazy Kat, Ignatz Mouse, Officer Pupp\u0097turned the traditional mouse-cat-dog hierarchy on its ear: in this case, the cat loved the mouse, mouse threw bricks at the cat, which the cat took as unending signs of love, and the dog tried to protect the cat.  By the time John Alden Carpenter (1876-1951) used the premise of the strip as the basis for a ballet, the strip was at the height of its popularity. A native of Chicago, Carpenter\u0092s exposure to some of the earliest performances of jazz in the northern United States led him to incorporate the new sounds into several of his instrumental works, at a time when much of the United States had no idea what the word \u0093jazz\u0094 even meant. Krazy Kat is subtitled A Jazz Pantomime; the stage directions (printed below) were meant to be acted out by characters in costume in front of a massive, moving background (not unlike an animated cartoon), which had been created by Herriman himself. Krazy Kat was first performed at Town Hall in New York on Friday, January 20, 1922, with Adolph Bohm acting the part of Krazy (and choreographing the show), and conducted by George Barr\u00e8re.\r\n\r\nKrazy Kat\r\n \u0093To those who have not mastered Mr. Herriman\u0092s psychology it may be explained that Krazy Kat is the world\u0092s greatest optimist\u0097Don Quixote and Parsifal rolled into one. It is therefore possible for him to maintain constantly at white heat a passionate affair with Ignatz Mouse in which the gender of each remains ever a delightful mystery. Ignatz, on the other hand, condenses in his sexless self all the cardinal vices. If Krazy blows beautiful bubbles, Ignatz shatters them; if he builds castles in Spain, Ignatz is there with the brick. In short, he is meaner than anything, and his complex is cats.\r\n\u0093After a few introductory bars the curtain is raised and Krazy is discovered asleep under a tree. Officer Pup passes, swinging his club. All is well. Then comes Bill Postem, a canine relative of Officer Pup, with his bucket and brush, and pastes upon the wall an announcement of the grand ball which will shortly be given for all the animals, The job finished, Bill departs.\r\n\u0093Krazy wakes up; he rubs his eyes and reads the exciting poster. He is moved to try his steps; he find his feet heavy and numerous. Of a sudden he spies on a clothes line which the moving scenery has brought into view, a ballet skirt. Undoubtedly it is his costume for the all. He approaches the clothes line, first with restraint, then with eagerness. He snatches the skirt from the line, claps it one, and comes bounding forward in high abandon.\r\n\u0093He is interrupted by the appearance of Old Joe Stork, drilling by with his bundle on his back. He passes on, but he has carelessly dropped his pack. Krazy sniffs at it, filled with curiosity. He picks it up and carries it triumphantly to his tree in the corner. He opens the bundle, and finds that it contains not what you thought it would, but a vanity case, mirror, rouge, powder-puff, lip-stick and all, complete, including a beautiful pair of white cotton gloves.\r\n\u0093He abandons himself to the absorbing task of make-up for the ball. Meanwhile the moving scenery has brought into view the house of Ignatz Mouse. The door opens, and Ignatz\u0092 head appears. Opportunity has knocked. The Mouse steals forward and is about to seize an inviting brick when Officer Pup (thank heaven!) arrives in the very nick of time and drives him from the scene. The unsuspecting Kat, in the meantime, has completed his make-up He now arises, draws on his white cotton gloves, and then by way of further preparatory exercise, he indulges in a bit of a Spanish dance.\r\n\t\u0093At its conclusion Krazy is suddenly confronted by the Mysterious Stranger. The sophisticated audience will observe that it is none other than Ignatz disguised as a catnip merchant. Very formidable indeed! The Stranger steps briskly forward and holds out to the ever-receptive Kat a bouquet\u0097an enormous bouquet of catnip. Krazy plunges his nose into the insidious vegetable, inhales deeply to the very bottom of his lungs, and then goes off at once into what Mr. Herriman calls a Class A fit. It is a fit progressive, a fit de luxe, the Katnip blues, in which the wily Ignatz joins as additional incitement. When the frenzy has achieved its climax, the Mouse throws off his disguise, seizes his brick, dashes it full in the face of the Kat, and escapes. Krazy staggers back, stunned and exhausted, but yet undaunted. Ther is the moment of ecstatic recognition\u0097Ignatz Dahlink\u0097as he totters and reels back to his little tree. He sinks down wearily under its protecting boughs. The moon comes out. Krazy sleeps. Krazy dreams.

Essentially it is concerned with a celebration of the Roman ritual using the Latin text of the Catholic liturgy; but simultaneously there is a subtext in English reflecting the reactions, doubts, protests, and questionings - positive and negative - of all of us who are attending and perceiving this ritual. By \"all of us\" I mean to include all who are assembled on stage and, by extension, the audience itself.\r\n     The ritual is conducted by a young man of mysterious simplicity (called the Celebrant) who throughout the drama is invested by his acolytes with increasingly ornate robes and symbols which connote both an increase in the superficial formalism of his obligation and of the burden that he bears. There is a parallel increase in the resistance of the Congregants - in the sharpness and bitterness of their reactions and in the deterioration of his own faith. At the climax of Communion, all ceremony breaks down and the Mass is shattered. It then remains for each individual on the stage to find a new seed of faith within himself through painful meditation, enabling each individual to pass on the embrace of peace (Pax) to his neighbor. This chain of embrace grows and spreads through the entire stage, ultimately into the audience and hopefully into the world outside.\r\n     The disposition of forces at the original production was: in the pit, an orchestra of strings only, plus two organs and a percussion section. All other instrumentalists are on stage in costume and function as members of the cast. These include wind, brass and percussion players, as well as Rock instrumentalists. There are three choruses: a formal choir seated in pews, a Boys' Choir, and a so-called Street Chorus, many of whom function as vocal or dancing soloists and groups. All these forces perform with, against, or around the Celebrant. At certain moments of extreme tension, the Celebrant tries to control the situation by saying \"Let us pray,\" and it is at these moments that the Meditations are played by the pit orchestra, while the entire company remains motionless in attitudes of prayer, or contemplates ceremonial dance.\r\n    - Leonard Bernstein", "composer": 8, "title": "Three Meditations from"}}, {"pk": 19, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "In keeping with our tradition of performing some dance music on the last concert of the year, I've chosen to tackle {Fancy Free} which is considered by many to be one of the most challenging American ballet scores ever written.

An ever-advancing economy of musical means and tightening of structure proceeds from one show to the next. It was almost predictable from this trend that when West Side Story hit Broadway like a bombshell, in September 1957, it would be hailed as a landmark in American theater. It was indeed recognized as a major leap toward an original kind of theatrical conception. Bernstein had speculated much earlier that a genuine, indigenous form of American musical theater would eventually arise out of what has been known as musical comedy. Many people think that, in {West Side Story}, this theory began to be implemented. Elements from the European and American musical stage traditions were fused into an original art form that is neither opera nor musical comedy.\r\n     From the Old World tradition came complicated vocal ensembles, such as the {Quintet} in Act 1; the use of music to project the story line forward (as in the duet \"A Boy Like That\"); the dramatic device of {leitmotifs} - for instance, the one associated with the reality of gang violence, as in the {Prologue}, or the one associated with the diametrically opposite vision of togetherness, as in the Finale.In addition, from Europe came the deductive-inductive species of developing musical materials, by basing much of the {West Side Story} score on transformations of the tritone interval, or by immediately developing the opening statement of any given song with melodic or rhythmic variation.\r\n     From the New World came idiomatic jazz and Latin timbres and figurations (most of the dance music); a fluid and constant change from word to music and from scene to scene, such as the second-act ballet that goes from accompanied spoken word into song, into dance and back again; and most important, the kinetic approach to the stage - communication though choreographic music - delineated, in concentrated form, by these {Symphonic Dances}.\r\n     Why are these dances called symphonic? Simply because the dance music, even in its original format, is symphonically conceived. Relatively few thematic ideas, combined with each other and metamorphosed into completely new shapes, are all that are necessary to meet varying dramatic requirements. This music on its own terms, music that does not have to depend upon presupposed knowledge of the unfolding events on stage.\r\n     However, for those who are interested in knowing what transpires on stage during the course of the dances, the following summary outlines the principal sections of the music (which is arranged so that one section flows into the next without a break):\r\n\r\n{Prologue} (Allegro moderato)\r\n     The growing rivalry between two teenage gangs, the Jets and the Sharks.\r\n\r\n{Somewhere} (Adagio)\r\n     In a dream ballet, the two gangs are united in friendship.\r\n\r\n{Scherzo} (Vivace e leggiero)\r\n     In the same dream, the gangs break away from the city walls, suddenly finding themselves in a playful world of space, air and sun.\r\n\r\n{Manbo} (Meno Presto)\r\n     In the real world again, the competitive dance at the gym between the gangs.\r\n\r\n{Cha-cha} (Andantino con grazia)\r\n     The star-crossed lovers Tony and Maria see each other for the first time; they dance together.\r\n\r\n{Meeting Scene} (Meno mosso)\r\n     Music accompanies their first words spoken to one another.\r\n\r\n{Cool Fugue} (Allegretto)\r\n     An elaborate dance sequence in which Riff leads the Jets in harnessing their impulsive hostility, figuratively \"cooling their jets.\"\r\n\r\n{Finale} (Adagio)\r\n     Maria's \"I Have a Love\" develops into a procession, which recalls the vision of \"Somewhere\".\r\n    - Jack Gottlieb", "composer": 8, "title": "West Side Story"}}, {"pk": 21, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "When Kris Brooks (b. 1969) was only fourteen years of age, he heard a recording of music by J.S.

It is based on the namesake poem of the Afro-Cuban poet, Nicolas Guillen. (1904-1989) The poem is subtitled Chant to Kill a Snake. This work presents Revueltas at his best, revealing especially the unique rhythmic quality and richness of his music. The verses of the poem imitate onomatopoeically the sounds and rhythms of Afro-Cuban cult music. The words mayombe- bombe- mayombe, appear as a refrain and they solidify the basic rhythmic cell of the composition. The work builds to a grand climax created gradually through the thickening of the orchestration and the texture, (with the three main themes of the score combined contrapuntally), and through increased polyrhythms and dissonance.   \r\n \r\n                                                                         ~ Gerard Behague \r\n \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRest, brother, your day has come to an end, Now the stars of the Americas are your country and from this day the limitless earth will be your home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \r\nPablo Neruda, to Silvestre Revueltas, of Mexico, upon his death. \r\nIn the Chinese Zodiac, 2001 is the year of the snake.

This is a description, again, of the atmosphere, not a person necessarily born under this sign. \r\n{The Snake}: \r\nSolutions and compromises can be arrived at, but not without some mutual distrust at first. The Snake likes to resolve his differences one way or another. If he fails and things cannot be peacefully settled, then he will declare war. Looking back into history, we find that the year of the Snake has never been tranquil. \r\nPerhaps this is because it is the strongest negative force in the cycle and it follows the Dragon year, which is the strongest positive one. Many disasters, which had their beginning in the year of the Dragon, tend to culminate in the year of the Snake. These two signs are very closely related and the calamities of the Snake years often resulted from excesses committed during the Dragon's reign. The Snake's cool and collected front hides the deep and mysterious ways of his nature. It should be noted that once the Snake uncoils to strike, he moves like lightning and nothing can stop him. Similarly, changes that occur during the Snake's year can be as sudden and devastating.Tread lightly and be more cautious this year. The consequences will be overwhelming. The Snake is not merciful. \r\nI had decided to program Sensemaya for this concert this past June. After the tragedies this past September, I almost pulled the work from the program, thinking that it would be inappropriate to study a piece that was based on a poem about killing a living thing. After taking some time to ponder this, I then remembered that this is the year of the snake. I thought it important at that point to keep it on the program; through the study of this work, it has been emphasized in rehearsals that our interpretation of this piece would be to put at end to the wicked and foul atmosphere that the snake can create. With that in mind, we are focused on somehow helping to bring peace to our world, and an end to lives lost at the hands of evil.                                                                   \r\n~Liza Grossman \r\n\r\nSENSEMAYA   chant to kill a snake.

More than a hundred years of performance have demonstrated this verdict to be false, since the work is now undoubtedly one of the most popular of all Romantic piano concertos. Nor has the frequently voiced criticism that Grieg took Schumann's piano concerto as a basis for his form (especially in the first movement) affected its popularity in the slightest. ...The undoubted attractiveness of the concerto resides...in a combination of factors: firstly the original and memorable melodic material--Grieg mostly uses short phrases which he repeats frequently or builds up into sequences--then the colourful, refined harmonic language, obviously influenced by the \"New German School\", and finally some points of style suggested by Norwegian folk music...Not the least important reason for the concerto's popularity, of course, is its extremely effective solo part, with piano writing that owes much more to Liszt than to Chopin: the first movement cadenza with its virtuoso unfolding of the opening theme, for instance, would have been inconceivable without Liszt's innovations.

The Flute Concerto was preceded by concertos for cello and piano. Soon after came the Violin Concerto and the Oboe Concerto. Many new concertos have been written in the last few years, however musicians that want to play them are usually being hired by the orchestras to sell a subscription series with warehouses of the literature. All solo instrumentalists must compete with first-desk players for rare solo spots. Notwithstanding this situation, flutist Carol Wincenc was eager for a concerto from Tower. Wincenc had had enormous success with another new concerto, Lukas Foss\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Renaissance Concerto, and  is strongly commited to expanding the flute repertoire. Tower had previously written Snow Dreams for her and guitarist Sharon Isbin, and Wincenc had \u00e2\u0080\u009cenormous personal affection for Joan as an individual and as a player. She is a complete musician in every sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wincenc particularly admires Tower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfantastic understanding of the line,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and believed that Tower would write a piece to show off the flute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lyrical and virtuosic qualities advantageously. On Tower\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, she admits that it was particularly intimidating to write a Flute Concerto: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always faced with the problem of the flute being overpowered by the orchestra. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to keep the orchestra away from the flute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She solved the dilemma by keeping the orchestra small and entirely omitting \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsorbing\u00e2\u0080\u009d instruments such as the horn. She limited the use of the flute\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quiet lower register to the unusual and lovely soliloquy with which the concerto commences. Tower keeps the soloist busy, and engages it in several duets with the orchestra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flute and percussion. The soloist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figurations include rapid scales and arpeggios as well as melodic patterns that emphasize thirds, fifths and octaves.

The composer and original soloist spent long hours  together refining matters of articulation and phrase length. The Concerto gets progressively more energetic.

It was, however, too difficult to re-write directly from what I had been given. I asked him if I could re-work the piece as my own, using his ideas. He gave me a terrific structure to work with; the framework was solid.  I ended up writing the concerto with him in mind as the soloist.  As far as the outline of the piece, I kept to his idea of dividing the movements up in the orchestra; that is giving the first movement to the strings, second to the brass, third to the woodwinds. I added the elements of having the percussion section play each movement with the soloist, and bringing the entire orchestra together on the fourth movement, which recalls the style and motifs of the first movement.

Sibelius was detached from blatant political measures yet he subtly participated in nationalistic activities by portraying patriotism through his music.  \r\n\r\nSibelius composed music for a series of tableaux on themes of Finnish historical events. Finlandia accompanied the final tableaux which portrayed the devastation of Finland during the 18th century Nordic war. The text that accompanied this music read, (in part): \"The powers of darkness menacing Finland have not succeeded in their terrible threats. Finland awakes...\"        His prelude music to Finland Awakes!  was so popular that he eventually took it from the suite and published it separately in 1900 as Finlandia.

It's subtitle is \"Vincent\", which is the way the artist habitually signed his work. In 1986, the two suites from Le Tambourin shared first prize in the Friedheim Awards at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C.\r\n\r\nCompleted in October 1984, each of the two suites, which may be performed separately, consists of three short movements, scored for large orchestra. The musical character of each of the individual movements was prompted by specific visual characteristics found in certain paintings and drawings by Van Gogh. Musical depiction of the paintings' subject matter was not a concern or a consideration. Rather the relationship is confined to technique in matters of harmony and dissonance, of color and light, energy and intensity of brush stroke, shape, clarity, and focus of image, and their overall formal structural deployment. Nevertheless, Van Gogh painted and drew with such fervor and passion that often the technical aspects of his work are simultaneous translations of his own inner turmoil, anxiety, rage, joy, love, and depression.\r\n\r\nListeners can determine to what extent a musical \"transcription\" of the art work carries corresponding emotive qualities.\r\n\r\n4. {The Night Cafe}\r\nThere are two paintings of cafes at night: one an outdoor scene with light flooding from the windows, illuminating the sidewalks, chairs, and tables against a starlit night sky; the other (The All-Night Cafe) is a desolate interior scene depicted in the most extreme color contrasts; \"blood red and dark yellow with a green billiard table in the middle; there are four citron-yellow lamps with a glow of orange and green. Everywhere there is a clash....\"\r\n\r\n5. {Dance at Arles}\r\nA complex of figures dancing, painted in somber colors with the jet-black hair and hats of the women giving a macabre quality to the social scene.\r\n\r\n6. {The Church at Auvers}\r\nPainted in bold, simple lines allied to an electric quality of color - a cobalt-blue sky and acid-green grass. A fragment of a hymn was found in the prayer book that Van Gogh used during his ministry in the Borinage (a Belgian coal-mining area where he worked as a Calvinist missionary in his twenties). That fragment helped to generate much of the musical material of the two suites.\r\n\r\nSuite No. 2 was commissioned by the Koussevitzky Foundation and is dedicated to the memory of Serge and Natalie Koussevitzky.

His violin compositions are standards of the virtuoso repertoire. His most famous works for the instrument\u00e2\u0080\u0094Havanaise, Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, and the Third Concerto in B minor\u00e2\u0080\u0094were each instant successes, featuring saucy Iberian themes, virtuosic tricks, and powerful climaxes. The Concerto is also popular as a debut vehicle, and such artists as Hilary Hahn, Leila Josefowicz, and Pinchas Zukerman all made Cleveland Orchestra debuts with the piece.                                                                         \r\n\r\nDedicated to the Spanish violinist Pablo de Sarasate, the B minor Concerto has elements of French, Spanish, and Italian motives. The first movement, representing an easygoing, Parisian feel, quickly became popular with the audiences due to its \"poetic atmosphere and compelling melodiousness\" (George Bernard Shaw). The movement is in A-B-A-B-A form, with sentimental phrases sandwiched between pyrotechnical exploits. The original opening melody, played for the first thirty bars on the violin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lowest string, the G-string, returns to launch the coda, driven by an ever increasing crescendo and tempo, utilizing every position on the instrument. \r\n\r\nThe second movement, based off of a simple Siciliano melody, is very much chamber music between the solo violin and principal winds, as the phrase is handed back and forth between the oboe, flute, clarinet, and violin. The rhythmic pulse is leisurely, the mood is always uplifting, and the soaring melodies demonstrate the vocal qualities of the instrument. The violin concludes the movement with arpeggios in artificial harmonics. \r\n\r\nThe third movement begins with a rhapsodic, cadenza feeling, leading to a sensuous, energetic Spanish theme that is reminiscent of the dedicatee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (de Sarasate) own music. The movement is fast-paced until the orchestral violins introduce the secondary melody, which is the only lapse in the spirited pulse. The tension and virtuosity increase until the coda, marked Presto. The movement finishes with a dynamic flourish, bringing the concerto to a heroic ending. \r\n\r\nPablo de Sarasate premiered the concerto in 1881, and the concerto was published the following year. I first learned this concerto when I was 14 in Vermont, and again in the summer of 2003. It has always been one of my favorites due to it's accessibility and rich themes. The concerto shows off many palettes of the instrument, and is ultimately a rewarding piece. \r\nI would like to dedicate this performance to twelve years of inspiring guidance and friendship from Ms. Liza Grossman. \r\n\r\n~Andrew Sords March, 2004", "composer": 73, "title": "Violin Concerto, no. 3, op.61 in B minor"}}, {"pk": 114, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "Life without music would be impossible.

One cannot help but appreciate the vast scale of such magnificent human achievements in light of life's inevitable decay. We know we will die, poised on the very brink of our own extinction, yet we still strive to transcend our own mortality, in defiance of fate. We hold our heroes very dear to our hearts - we praise them and their achievements, and in praising we ourselves begin to succumb to the glory of it all.

Not that I would ever claim to be anywhere close to Mahler, perhaps the most perfect purveyor of this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but to try to capture pain in both its universal semblance as it simultaneously relates to each and every individual is what this piece is meant to convey. The symphony of the late Romantic period was often set in a minor key with some sort of explosion to major at the conclusion\u00e2\u0080\u0093 to bring dark to light, as it were. This piece begins dark, and stays dark and gets darker. \r\n \r\nThe clich\u00c3\u00a9s of what causes one heartbreak are indeed such clich\u00c3\u00a9s that we often disregard their power. The death of a loved one, the loss of a spouse or a friend or a lover, the never ending underlying pain in the gut you wonder will ever go away \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these are the feelings I called upon when I started constructing this piece. I had a small sketch with nothing but \u00e2\u0080\u009cDark Morning\u00e2\u0080\u009d written on it from years ago which became the motive the solo trumpet declares at m.15 of the first tableau. \r\n \r\nThere is something about night that always seems much more conducive to those in pain. When someone is in dark despair, the night becomes some sort of blanket for one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pain and tears. The darkness and the relative lack of activity seem to almost tell you that, for those dark hours, the world understands. But if anyone has ever seen the sun begin to rise, on a day when you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure how much longer you can go on, then one can begin to perhaps understanding what I am trying to convey by the titles of the sections of this piece. The underlying theme is always of not wanting the night to leave, no matter how painful. The promise of the coming day\u00e2\u0080\u0093 something we should always usually thank God for (or the deity of your choice) becomes nothing but a horror that magnifies the despair\u00e2\u0080\u0093 the sunrise mocking the pain. The morning where everyone normal goes about their daily life and duties when you are in so much grief you are afraid you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk across the floor\u00e2\u0080\u0093 THIS is what I have attempted to convey in this very dark work.\r\n \r\nMusically set in 5 sections I have called Tableau (Thank you Mr. Debussy and Mr. Stravinsky) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of which have tutti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with material of such extensive importance that inspired me to change the title designation from just Concerto to Concerto/Symphony \u00e2\u0080\u0093 each section has a mood and a numerology description in the form of a time. \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU I: 3:28am - The Morning You Left Me}\r\nThis tableau has the first announcement of the soloists giving the notes F# B D C#\u00e2\u0080\u0093 which generate a great amount of the material for the whole piece. Different rhythmic patterns alternate to convey pain bordering on psychosis. \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU II: 4:18am \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The Morning the Snowfall Tried to Comfort Me; I Preferred the Snowstorm}\r\nA calm arpeggiated figure meant to illustrate falling snow, interrupted by a very intense snowstorm\u00e2\u0080\u0093 to this point in my career the most complex music I have ever written with the snowstorm music containing seven different ideas going on at once. \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU III: 2:26am \u00e2\u0080\u0093 My Pain Dances like the Spilled Scotch in the Firelight and like the Dead Leaves in the Wind.}\r\nThis is an angry, and oft-syncopated dance meant to convey a very sad person watching leaves blow in an angry, biting wind.  \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU IV: Painful, Sad Recollections of the Mornings (cadenza); March and Fugue over Dreading the Sunrise}\r\nA cadenza for the soloists opens this section and then 2 long sections of fugue themes\u00e2\u0080\u0093 one a death march \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one more of a blare meant to imply angst at the coming sunrise.  \r\n\r\n{TABLEAU V: 6:36am \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Pain and Anger at the Sunrise}\r\nThere is a long build of juxtaposed chords before a theme, which to me sounds like off-kilter Shostakovich\u00e2\u0080\u0093 this theme mixed in with a rock rhythm. The piece grows more and more frenzied until the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime\u00e2\u0080\u009d of this piece\u00e2\u0080\u0093 6:36 AM is revealed in the intro to the coda - 6 very loud plucked strings and harp and chime chords, followed by three 12-tone rows in the winds. The opening string flourish from the beginning of the piece leads to the rock rhythm ending in one final primal scream of pain\u00e2\u0080\u0093 before the rock rhythm brings the piece to a close with a loud burst of despair. \r\n \r\nDespite all the darkness in the piece, may I say again how proud, blessed and thankful I am for my music having been connected to CYO for now more than half its existence. The recognition it has brought for my music and career is inestimable and I could not be more thrilled to write another piece for the Contemporary Youth Orchestra and two members of the Cleveland Orchestra. I hope the joy in creating this premiere is as equally proportional to all the pain that was recalled in the creation of the music.   \r\n\r\nP.

Although my piece is not programmatic, the juxtaposed images of Manhattan, where I live and study during the school year, and the reflection of past memories, suggested a resonant title for my own work. \r\n\r\nThe work consists of three connected sections that are fundamentally fast-slow-fast.

He began studying at St. Petersburg Conservatory at the age of ten, and produced his first major musical achievement, his First Symphony, at age nineteen. He would later become a composition teacher at the Conservatory. As a composer in Communist Russia, Shostakovich's music was often condemned by Stalin and the Communist government as being too formalistic. With Stalin's death in 1953 came the end of Shostakovich's musical oppression. Shostakovich greatly admired the music of Bach, Beethoven, Mahler, and Berg, and the influence of these composers shows through in much of Shostakovich's music. He is most well-known for his symphonies and his string quartets. Shostakovich died of lung cancer in 1975 in Moscow. \r\n\r\nThe Second Piano Concerto, written in 1957, was a nineteenth birthday present for the composer's son, Maxim. Maxim premiered the concerto on May 10, 1957, with the U.S.S.R State Symphony. Unlike a good deal of Shostakovich's other compositions, the concerto is devoid of all codes and hidden messages. Instead, it is full of such energy, vitality, and mischief that it is considered to be a \"character study\" of Maxim. The light-hearted vigor of this piece is also thought to be owed to the death of Stalin. The third movement is a quick-stepping Allegro, in which the momentum never ceases. The end of the slow second movement leads directly into the chattering duple-time opening of the third movement. This first theme is interrupted by a lively 7/8 theme, which recurs several times throughout the movement. The third movement is filled with passages of scales and arpeggios that are taken directly out of the Hanon finger exercises which, according to the composer, were included in the concerto because this was the only way that he could get his son to practice them. The first theme of the movement is brought back at the end, and the concerto ends in a brilliant finale.\r\n\r\n~Gina Ardillo\r\n2005", "composer": 78, "title": "Concerto No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra, opus 102, 1957"}}, {"pk": 122, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "{This performance of Schelomo is a result of the CYO concerto opportunity auditions.

Bloch wrote most of his music in Geneva, where he had his second period, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cJewish Cycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He composed Schelomo:Hebraic Rhapsody for Violoncello and Orchestra in 1916.  The works that Bloch wrote during the Jewish Cycle are the works that he is famous for today, although they make up less than 20 percent of his pieces.  He did not borrow from other traditional works, but rather he considered his compositions his own works, which borrowed the soul of the Hebrew Scriptures.  As William Henrichs said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is Jewish\u00e2\u0080\u00a6in the same sense that Debussy was French, Sibelius Finnish, or Bart\u00c3\u00b4k Hungarian, and in that sense he may be identified with a kind of Hebrew Nationalism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bloch founded the Cleveland Institute of Music in 1920 and directed it until 1925.  He also directed the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and taught at the University of California at Berkeley.  \r\n\tDuring his Jewish period, Bloch began to develop ideas for a work based on Solomon (Schelomo being Solomon in Hebrew) and the book of Ecclesiastes, which is attributed to Solomon.  At the time, Bloch was concerned with the harshness of war, World War I having just broken out the year before, and began writing this piece for voice and orchestra.  He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor years I had been sketching a musical setting of Ecclesiastes, but neither French, German, nor English suited my purpose and I did not know enough Hebrew\u00e2\u0080\u00a6One day I met the cellist Alexander Barjansky...I began to think about writing a work for that marvelous cellist.  Why not use my Ecclesiastes material, but instead of a human voice, limited by a text, employ an infinitely grander and more profound voice that could speak all languages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that of his violoncello?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The work displays a huge amount of emotional intensity. The solo cello plays a meditative voice of Solomon and the orchestra represents the voice of the world around Solomon, and also at times, his inner voice.\r\n\r\n\tSchelomo is divided into three large sections, each with a grand orchestral interlude.  The opening of the piece starts with a cello cadenza, signifying the voice of Solomon, slowly falling into darkness at the end.  This leads into the first theme, played by the orchestra, which is eventually joined by solo cello. Interrupted by a minor orchestral climax and a cadenza-like passage from the solo cello, the music begins to build to the orchestra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first large climax.  After the orchestra quiets to a piano, the cello interrupts with a repeat of the opening cadenza, which leads into the second theme.  While Bloch usually creates his own themes, here we see the use of the Jewish melody Kodosh Attoh (Holy art Thou).  First played by solo oboe,  it is played again by the rest of the woodwinds over the cello cadenza\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme, a technique used often throughout the piece.  While the orchestra builds with the second theme, the cello has outbursts of quintuplets in the upper register, trying again and again to hold back the energy of the orchestra, but failing each time until the orchestra reaches the second climax.  Again the orchestra diminishes, but even softer this time, in which the cello plays a soft, sorrowful development of parts of the first theme over low strings and timpani.  After further development, the cello desends to a low D, from which the orchestra fades into a peaceful dream-like mood, and the cello rises in register, almost carried off by the orchestra, until it falls slowly down to a low G, in which a soft military theme in the orchestra, played earlier in the piece returns, with a lyrical English Horn.  With help of the solo cello, the music builds to its final climax.  After dying down a final time, the solo cello enters with a final repeat of the opening cadenza, ending the piece in a melancholy, tragic mood.  Bloch said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlmost all my works, however gloomy, end with an optimistic conclusion or at least with hope: This is the only one which ends with an absolute negation.  But the subject required it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVanity of vanities, says the teacher, vanity of vanities!  All is vanity.

Following his studies, Holst earned his living as an orchestral trombonist and, in 1905, was appointed as the Director of Music at the St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s School in Hammersmith. His \u00e2\u0080\u0098St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Suite for string orchestra\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was named for this school. It is during this time that he wrote his most famous work, The Planets (1917), an orchestral suite consisting of seven movements. The London Symphony Orchestra under Albert Coates presented the first performance of the full suite on November 15, 1920 at Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hall, London.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to music critic Herbert Thompson, Holst explained that his motivation for the work and his choice of titles and subtitles were suggested by the astrological significance of the planets and not by classical mythology. It is important to note that because Earth is the point by which astrological observations are made and because Pluto was not discovered until 1930, neither of these planets is represented in the suite. Richard Greene, author of the book \u00e2\u0080\u009cHolst: The Planets\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggests that the order of the movements represent an outward journey into the unknown and that the music is about human character, for which planetary influence is the ruling metaphor. Mr. Greene explains that this outward journey implied by the unique order of the movements is paralleled by a psychological and a philosophical journey as well as to form a conceptual plot: a single character moving deliberately from physical aggression and ambition (Mars) to metaphysical and mystical serenity (Neptune). \r\n\r\nAncient Greek philosophers were aware of astrological knowledge and opinions. Music resulting from astrology is incredibly rare. It was the Greek philosophers who had the idea of the \"Music of the Spheres\"; that planets must have a sound or hum as they floated in space. At this time, only seven planets were known: Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Interestingly, western music evolved with seven-tone scales. Music and astrology come together in this suite dedicated to the seven planets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 however Earth and the Moon are replaced by Uranus and Neptune. Gustav Holst was very familiar with the Greek philosophers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 idea of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMusic of the Spheres\u00e2\u0080\u009d and astrology and mythology. He used his knowledge of these ideas during the composition of The Planets.}\r\n\r\n{The score calls for piccolo, 3 flutes, bass flute, 2 oboes, english horn, bass oboe, 3 clarinets, bass clarinet, 4 bassoons, contra bassoon, 4 trumpets, 6 horns, 3 trombones, bass trombone, tenor tuba, bass tuba, 2 sets of timpani, percussion, 2 harps, celesta, organ, strings and women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chorus.}\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mars: The Bringer of War] is said to be the ruler in Aries and Scorpio. Mars means a hard fight against everything that you find immoral - this force gives one courage and strength. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thorny paths and conflicts are always stimulating to Mars, who thrives on debate and controversy. The personality of the planet is motion, intensity and resolve. Naturally, energy of this type must have a moral motivation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 When good is the goal, the results are magnificent, but undirected; some of the most shocking battles have been the result of the Mars force. Mars was seen by Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contemporaries as a parallel to the horrors of World War I. The terror of warfare confronts us face to face in this bleakest of all tone poems. The movement begins vigorously with strings and percussion sounding a rhythmic sequence in 5/4, (a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccutting edge\u00e2\u0080\u009d meter of its time) forming an ostinato that gives the section its merciless pace. Unresolved harmonies and unrelated chords create clashing dissonances that appropriately depict conflict; tanks pound cities into ruins - bullets fly and bombs descend. It is surprising that Holst completed this piece before the start of World War I - before the invention of the tank, before the use of poisonous gas. The opening theme is transformed into a triumphant declaration before closing with stunning brutality.\r\n\r\n[Venus: The Bringer of Peace] is said to be the ruler in Taurus and Libra and very fruitful in Pisces. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Venus is the planet that rules the factor of love, beauty and the social whirl in our lives. Venus governs according to the position in the horoscope worldly goods; the form of money, jewels, and all the luxuries of life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The calming contrast of Venus is a relief after Mars' fury. Though Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subtitle strays somewhat from the astrologically \u00e2\u0080\u009cVenusian\u00e2\u0080\u009d characteristics of devoted love, beauty and passion, he provides us with a symbolic opposition of war and peace when comparing it to the previous movement. This lyrical tone poem has no brass other than french horns which allows the lush strings to dominate. Peaceful melodies lead to a romantic interlude with harps and celesta that fades to an ethereal ending. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The very picture of beauty - this is the Venus of ancient Rome: a sprite of gardens and flowers, feminine without wiliness or deceit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\r\n \r\n[Mercury: The Winged Messenger] is a fleeting scherzo and is said to be the ruler in Gemini and Virgo. Mercury is an intellectual force that rules common sense and is a symbol of what one thinks and how one expresses thoughts. Mercury governs speed and journeys short and fleet; the ancient Greeks described him as \"The Messenger of the Gods\". Holst crafts astrology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009csymbol of the mind\u00e2\u0080\u009d with quick arpeggio and scale-like passages connecting one instrument to another. Mercury abounds in polyrhythms; some instruments playing in 6/8 while others are in 2/4. The movement has an ethereal, restless quality evoking Mercury as he flits about through this piece, represented primarily by the woodwinds and sounding not unlike a \u00e2\u0080\u0098cosmic butterfly\u00e2\u0080\u0099. He surely belongs in the Garden of Venus that precedes him!\r\n \r\n[Jupiter: The Bringer of Jollity] is said to be the ruler in Sagittarius and also very powerful in Pisces. The planet, called by the ancient Greeks as \"The Greater Fortune\", \u00e2\u0080\u0098represents religious urges, philosophical thoughts, and dreams of vast accomplishments and great ideals. The personality of Jupiter is jovial, expansive, generous and benign.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Perhaps the best-known of the tone-poems, the spirit of this music is very much in keeping with the astrological significance of Jupiter. This Jupiter has a wide smile and a twinkle in his eyes. He invites all of the women to dance, however he does not seem to favor any one of the women more than the others; he is one of those men who adores all women simply because they are women. Jupiter evokes both a sense of fun and, according to Holst, \"the more ceremonial type of rejoicing associated with religious or national festivities.\" Beginning with a spirited tune against swiftly moving strings and woodwinds, the movement quickly brings forth several celebratory themes. Holst set one of the melodies as a separate hymn, \"I vow to thee my country.\" The hymn ends on an unresolved chord that is instantly met by the jolly motifs of the first section, drawing to a brilliant finish.\r\n \r\n[Saturn: The Bringer of Old Age] was Holst's favorite movement. Saturn is known as the \"Old Man of the Zodiac\" and is said to be the ruler of Capricorn. Saturn is considered a teacher and a mentor, though not too soft spoken. Peaceful and deliberate are the words best describing the tone of this piece. A slow, repeated two-note pattern played first by flutes and harps reminds the listener of relentless time. When Saturn arrives, he is not nearly as dreadful as his heavy steps led us to believe. The deliberation is still there, yet what he creates for us is not without its beauty; sparkling snowflakes, changing leaves, calm in recognition of his own mortality - at ease. The inevitable procession leads to a broad climax with clanging bells that suggests a ringing clock or a church chime. Peace is made with time: the movement subsides in calm harmony with the now-distant bell. Its expressions of resolution are enriched by the experiences encountered by the earlier movements. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The unrelenting passage of time admits no exceptions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - all are brought to judgment before the calm ending.\r\n\r\n[Uranus: The Magician] is not the god Uranus of mythology we meet here, but Uranus as the ruler of astrological Aquarius. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Greater Mind\" Uranus \u00e2\u0080\u0098suggests connection with advanced planes of thought, gathered from a loftier existence in a planetary system that has not been studied.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Opening with a pretentious four-note figure in the brass, which was labeled by Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter Imogen as \u00e2\u0080\u009can incantation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (a spell), the orchestra in its fullest use in the suite whips itself into a grand march of great eccentricity. There are similarities here with Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice, especially in the use of bassoon and contrabassoon in the opening. Far removed from the earthly properties of the earlier movements, an erratic and clever yet non-aggressive sorcerer is suggested; he clearly has a lot of fun conjuring up his spells. He is a Magician who cannot keep his secrets - this magician is clumsy and accident prone but also a performer who just cannot resist trying once more ... but his whimsical nature has deep wisdom and knowledge of the infinite. On the last try, \u00e2\u0080\u0098he gets it right and we hear the opening of the doorway into eternity\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - everything suddenly drops to an awed hush: the sorcerer has evidently worked a real spell and brought us to the last movement.\r\n\r\n[Neptune: The Mystic] is the eternity that Uranus has revealed to us. Neptune is said to be the ruler of Pisces with a strong influence on Cancer. Neptune represents dreams and visions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it is delicate and subtle; perhaps a little poetic. Instructing the orchestra to {\u00e2\u0080\u009cplay sempre pianissimo throughout - dead tone\u00e2\u0080\u009d}, Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final movement is the most visionary and impressionist of the suite. The abyss opens and we step out into the void. Its sparse orchestration paints a mystical state. We have a sense of floating through empty space, through Neptune's watery depths. Celestial harmonies envelop us and Holst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final diminuendo brings resolution of fulfillment and serenity. It depicts, as nearly as possible, the remoteness and mystery of this distant blue-green planet. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We hear choirs of angels receding into the distance.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\r\n\r\nIf Pluto had been discovered while The Planets was being written, one wonders what Holst may have done musically with the astrological description of the personality and traits of the distant planet.\r\n \r\n[Pluto:] \u00e2\u0080\u0098Pluto is the planet of regeneration and reform. Pluto governs sex and reproduction. Life under Pluto passes silently from this plane into the unknown. It might be recalled that in Greek mythology, Pluto was the king of the underworld, dark and turgid, but at a special plea of mankind he allowed his wife to visit the earth every year. Her coming was a rebirth of joy. We call it springtime. Pluto removes conditions as well as persons, and starts the tide of rebirth. In matters of reform Pluto is unlike Uranus. The Pluto type of reformation takes the form of penance.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Pluto along with Mars represents Aries and Scorpio.\r\n\r\nThe astrological signs not represented in the suite are linked to the following:          \r\n\r\n[Leo:] Ruler of the Sun \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t          \r\n[The Sun] is the planet of the self, energy and power. \u00e2\u0080\u0098In astrology it symbolizes everything we are trying to become, the center around which all our activity in life revolve. This Planet represents the spirit and what it is that makes the individual unique. Everything in the horoscope ultimately revolves around this singular body. It is the Sun which gives strength to the other Planets, which is why this Planet occupies a key role in Astrology. It is the symbol of strength, wisdom, dignity and generosity.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \r\n\r\n[Cancer:] Ruler of the Moon\r\n\t\t                                  \r\n[The Moon] is the planet of the unconscious mind, habits and emotions. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Since the Moon is closest to Earth it influences us more deeply than any other Planet. The effect is very personal, very intimate. Whereas the Sun gives us our spirit, it's the Moon which gives us our soul. The Moon is goddess-like in that it symbolizes mother and the relationship between woman and child. The moon speaks to the women in one's life and their role as nurturer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\r\n\r\nClassical astrology considered all planets in the study of astrology beginning with the Sun and the Moon; also known as luminaries. \r\n \r\nLiza Grossman, 2005", "composer": 25, "title": "The Planets, op. 32"}}, {"pk": 124, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "John Stuart Ely, III, is the Marimba soloist for this performance.

The movement is filled with rhythmic ostinati i.e., repeated patterns. They are presented throughout the whole movement. \r\n\r\nServing as a tranquil transition to the first movement is [CALM].  Expressive playing from the winds and strings captivates a unique blend with the marimba in this movement. Featuring four-mallet choral work, the marimba plays relaxing chords while expressive runs in the middle are prominent before finally fading to an end.   \r\n\r\nThe third movement, [LIVELY], begins with an animated dance in 6/8. Idiomatic scales and arpeggios are strung throughout the movement. A sudden switch to 2/4 intersects the opening two themes before the orchestra sets up the ending. Returning back to the beginning statement of the movement, the intensity is driven towards the end by the marimba before the dramatic ending.   \r\n\r\nRuth Stuber premiered the concerto in 1940 with conductor Frederique Petrides and her Orchestrette Classique women's orchestra at Carnegie Hall.  It has always been one of my favorites due to its intriguing wind and string parts that correspond beautifully with the solo marimba part. The concerto demonstrates many sounds and colors that the instrument can produce. This performance is dedicated to my close friends who have continuously given endless support toward my music endeavors. \r\n\r\n~ John Stuart Ely, III, 2005", "composer": 84, "title": "Concertino for Marimba and Orchestra"}}, {"pk": 125, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "{The conceptual and multifaceted composer/conductor Tan Dun has made an indelible mark on the world's music scene with a creative repertoire that spans the boundaries of classical, multimedia, Eastern and Western musical systems. As a conductor whose primary interest is in creating programs that reach a new and diverse audience and which break the boundaries between classical and non-classical, East and West, avant-garde and indigenous art forms, Tan Dun has led many of the world's leading orchestras.\r\n\r\nCentral to his body of work, Tan Dun has composed distinct series of works which reflect his individual compositional concepts and personal ideas. Among them are the Orchestral Theatre Series, bringing his childhood memories of shamanistic ritual into symphonic performances; \r\nOrganic Music, consisting of works which incorporate elements from the natural world, such as the Water Concerto for Water Percussion and Orchestra commissioned and premiered by the New York Philharmonic with Kurt Masur, and Paper Concerto for Paper Instruments and Orchestra for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Esa-Pekka Salonen for the openings of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in October 2003; \r\nConcerto Multimedia, including the symbolic work The Map: Concerto for Cello, Video and Orchestra premiered by Boston Symphony Orchestra and Yo-Yo Ma with the composer conducting.\r\n\r\nBased in New York, Tan Dun was born in Simao, China. Having served as a rice-planter and performer of Peking opera during the Cultural Revolution, he later studied at Beijing's Central Conservatory. He holds a doctoral degree in musical arts from Columbia University of New York.  Among the many international honors he has received, Tan Dun was elected by Toru Takemitsu for the Glenn Gould Prize in Music Communication, and by Hans Werner Henze for the Munich International Music Theatre Award. Tan Dun was the music director of the Tanglewood Contemporary Music Festival in 1999 and artistic director of the London Barbican Centre's international festival in 2000. Currently, he is the music director of a multimedia festival with the Orchestre de la Radio Flamande. \r\nTan Dun records for Sony Classical and Deutsche Grammophon. His recordings have received many honors, including a Grammy Award (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Best CD of Contemporary Music of Japan's Recording Academy Awards 2003 (Water Passion after St. Matthew) and the BBC's Best Orchestral Album (Death and Fire). Tan Dun's manuscript of The Map was acquired recently by Carnegie Hall for its Composers Gallery in New York.\r\n\r\nThe score calls for 2 flutes, 2 piccolos, 2 oboes,2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 2 trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, percussion, harp, strings, solo cello and children's chorus.}\r\n\r\nCommissioned by the Hong Kong government in 1996 to celebrate the reunification of Hong Kong with China on July 1, 1997, Tan Dun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 70-minute {Heaven Earth Mankind -Symphony 1997} features the bianzhong in a dramatic montage that captures the panorama of human history and the longings of our spirit. Like the city of Hong Kong itself, Symphony 1997 joins the cultures of East and West. It reflects the Chinese aesthetic of using celebratory music as a vehicle for spiritual contemplation, while simultaneously featuring lush Romantic harmonies and sweeping lines characteristic of Western music. Tan Dun conspicuously adapts African rhythms, as well as melodies well known to audiences in the East (an aria from the Cantonese opera The Flower of the Emperor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daughter), the West (Beethoven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cOde to Joy\u00e2\u0080\u009d), and around the world (\u00e2\u0080\u009cJasmine Flower,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a revered Chinese folksong further immortalized in Puccini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s {Turandot}). The cello employs Eastern performing techniques. Taoist philosophy colors the Symphony through its tripartite division into spheres of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind; and a plethora of yin/yang contrasts: the eternal and the ephemeral; the visible and the hidden; the new and the old. A hymn to universal freedom and peace, and a spiritual descendent of Beethoven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ninth Symphony, Tan Dun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Symphony 1997 envisions a new world \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one in which the arrogance of isolationism, colonialism, and imperialism has finally yielded to a global community. \r\n\r\nIn the exuberant [Dragon Dance], large, colorful paper serpents snake through crowded streets at Chinese New Year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; the sensuous [Phoenix], with flowing melodies and harp cascades, presents the yin to Dragon Dance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vigorous yang. Together the heaven-dwelling, life-giving dragon (a symbol of the Emperor) and the Phoenix bird (his Empress) symbolize good luck. In Jubilation, strands of Beethoven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s {Ode to Joy} and a raucous Chinese folksong gradually blend into a collage of celebratory songs and traditions. The work blossoms with joyous melodies, although wartime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drums are not yet for in the past; children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voices, optimistic but world wise, look to the future. Written in the spirit of Li Po and recalling Schiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s text to {Ode to Joy,} Tan Dun's culminating anthem seeks the reunification of nature and soul in an enduring, harmonious world order. The chorus uses syllables of yearning and praying (\u00e2\u0080\u009cWu\u00e2\u0080\u009d), primitive cries of exertion (\u00e2\u0080\u009cHei ho hei\u00e2\u0080\u009d), joy (\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa\u00e2\u0080\u009d): these empty words, seemingly meaningless, express the fullness of life. \r\n\r\n{Heaven, Earth, and all Mankind,\r\nListen\r\nThe bells which no longer sound \u00e2\u0080\u009cfarewell\u00e2\u0080\u009d knock at spring\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door,\r\nThe wind of winter past blows the bugle of jubilation,\r\nThe drum, no longer announcing war, plays with everlasting harmony,\r\nThe mother, no longer crying, sings of joyous peace.\r\nAh!

His successful opera, Lady Macbeth was banned after Stalin saw it in 1936 and was offended by its veiled criticism of the Communist regime. This was no small matter; most who drew the dictator's wrath died soon after in a labor camp. Shostakovich was lucky, perhaps because the young composer had already achieved some international recognition, but the attacks in Pravda forced him to keep a packed suitcase beside his bed in case he was arrested in the night.\r\n\r\nIn such an atmosphere, and with a wife and two young children to worry about, it was only natural that Shostakovich would try to please the authorities. And he did, at least on the surface: the Fifth Symphony's subtitle is \u0093A Soviet Artist's Practical Creative Reply to Just Criticism.\u0094\r\n\r\nThe first movement is tragic, and its climax quite terrifying. A funeral march rhythm, played at double speed, develops into a threatening march of full brass and timpani, with strings and winds in disarray beneath. The peak, reached with most instruments playing near the top of their range, is followed by a powerful and near-unison descent, the loudest moment in the symphony, which then drops in dynamic to the soft and now slow funeral march. The movement ends with a solo Celeste, a sad and beautiful sound.\r\n\r\nThe second is a bold scherzo version of a Minuet that opens with tumultuous bass and cello. A solo violin and flute emerge, with pizzicato accompaniment from the strings, but it can all sound very insincere, even mocking. Depending on the interpretation, the movement can sound anything from delightful to callous.\r\n\r\nThe third, a Largo, is probably the most beautiful piece of music Shostakovich had written up to this point in his career. Brass and percussion are entirely absent, giving the movement a much more introverted and personal feel. It ranges in mood from early calm detachment, with soft strings and occasional flute and clarinet, to a terrible and incredibly powerful outpouring of grief at the climax, where the full strings together produce a sound as overwhelming as the brass chorales of the first movement. There are some very emotional solos, particularly for the cello section. The movement closes with the same sadness and serenity as the first.\r\n\r\nThe final movement is a remarkable contrast to the eloquence of the Largo. The movement has the surface optimism required to pacify the regime. \r\nIt is bombastic and exaggerated and perhaps considered arrogant and brutish by the end. There are some beautiful sections of peace, with solo strings and harp providing calm and reflection, but these are quickly snatched away, usually with slightly menacing snare drum. The conclusion is optimistic, but that does not save it from being threatening - it is the optimism of someone who really shouldn't be winning.\r\n\r\nHowever, this final movement, often criticized for sounding shrill, is declared in Testimony to be a parody of shrillness, representing \"forced rejoicing\". \r\n\r\nAnd of the finale, Shostakovich wrote in his memoirs (smuggled out of Russia after the composer's death):\r\n\r\n{\u0093What exultation could there be? I think it is clear to everyone what happens in the Fifth. The rejoicing is forced, created under threat... It's as if someone were beating you with a stick and saying \u0093Your business is rejoicing, your business is rejoicing,'' and you rise, shaky, and go marching off, muttering, \u0093Our business is rejoicing, our business is rejoicing.'' What kind of apotheosis is that? You have to be a complete oaf not to hear that.\u0094}\r\n\r\nThis is symbolized by the repeated \u0091A\u0092 at the end of the final movement in the violin and upper woodwind sections. It includes a quotation from the composer's song \"Rebirth\", accompanying the words \"A barbarian painter\" who \"blackens the genius's painting\". In the song, the barbarian's paint falls away and the original painting is reborn. It has been suggested that the barbarian and the genius are Stalin and Shostakovich respectively. The work is largely somber despite the composer's official claim that he wished to write a positive work.\r\n\r\nThroughout history, artists have thumbed their noses at authorities who were too dense to see through their parody and satire, and Shostakovich was no different. \r\n\r\nThe Fifth Symphony was very successful. The Russian government was pleased that the rebel had knuckled under, while the Russian people in the street saw the truth behind the facade. Western listeners took the work at face value and were overwhelmed by its grandeur and beauty. The symphony has become Shostakovich's most popular work, and the relatively recent revelation of its true meaning can only enhance our enjoyment of this testament to one persons struggle to express his people's anguish under a brutal tyrant.\r\n\r\n- Liza Grossman", "composer": 78, "title": "Symphony No. 5"}}, {"pk": 137, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "{Completed in 1954, Festive Overture is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 3 oboes, 3 clarinets, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, triangle, tamburo, snare drum, bass drum, strings.}\r\n\r\nThe story behind the creation of the Festive Overture is one of those fantastic tales that tells the true nature of a composer\u0092s genius, leaving all of us shaking our heads in wonder. \r\n\r\nShostakovich received the commission for this work literally days before the intended concert - a gathering at the Bolshoy Theatre in November 1954, celebrating the 37th anniversary of the 1917 October Revolution. Vasili Nebol'sin, a conductor at the Bolshoy Theatre, found himself in the potentially disastrous position of not having a celebratory work to open this very important concert. He approached Shostakovich hoping the composer would be willing to help. When Shostakovich agreed to write the opening piece, people transported the individual sheets of manuscript (still wet with ink) to the theatre where copyists would create the orchestral parts.\r\n\r\nLev Nikolayevich Lebedinsky, a musicologist and friend of Shostakovich, was at the composer's apartment when this exceptional commission arrived: \r\n\r\n{\u0093The speed with which he wrote was truly astounding. Moreover, when he wrote light music he was able to talk, make jokes and compose simultaneously, like the legendary Mozart. He laughed and chuckled, and in the meanwhile work was under way and the music was being written down. Dmitri with his strange, unpredictable, almost schizophrenic character, had the notion that I brought him good fortune, although to my knowledge I never brought him any particular luck. He said, `Lev Nikolayevich, sit down here beside me and I'll write the overture in no time at all.' Then he started composing. The speed with which he wrote was truly astounding.\u0094}\r\n\r\nWithin just two days the completed overture was in rehearsal. \r\n\r\nThere is not a trace of urgency or sloppiness in the vibrant Festive Overture. Shostakovich composed at a fast pace, writing with phenomenal ability. We will never know if he used musical ideas which were already swimming around in his head or whether the piece was an immediate genius of inspiration. It is fun to think of Shostakovich \u0093laughing and chuckling\u0094 as he composed, considering the composer\u0092s good humor driving this energetic, truly festive work.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Shostakovich, who had shaky nerves, conducted an orchestra only once, at a concert organized by his friend Mstislav Rostropovich in 1962.

My challenge in writing the piece was to combine two separate, self-contained ensembles: the string quartet, which excels at detail and delicacy; and the orchestra, which\u0097trading nimbleness for color and power\u0097requires the composer to paint with a big brush.  I used various strategies to synthesize these two groups: sometimes (as in movement 2), the orchestra accompanies while the quartet plays a melody, as a traditional soloist would; while at other times (like the latter part of movement 1) the quartet provides a complex rhythmic background, and the orchestra adds melodic material.  The final movement offers a reconciliation of sorts: by the end, the soloists have been incorporated into the main string sections, and delicacy has given way to a joyous free-for-all.\r\n\r\n{Broken Record} imagines an old phonograph playing some colorful popular music\u0097big band jazz, perhaps.  The record player doesn\u0092t work very well, however, and we hear the music through a haze of skips, pops, and repeats.  (Is that \u0093Oh when the saints \u0085\u0094 in the winds?)  After a brash orchestral introduction, the soloists enter with a typical \u0093concertoish\u0094 bravura passage.  The quartet plays a series of swaggering solo statements before getting stuck on a repetitive figure; this leads to a long crescendo and the return of the opening melody.  The last main section of the movement settles into D major and reinterprets the opening material.  The movement ends with a completely unmotivated turn to E major, reminiscent of the sudden \u0093up by step\u0094 modulations in popular music.\r\n\r\n{Settlement} is meant to evoke the idea of \u0093settling down\u0094\u0097but it also brings to my mind the image of a desolate, frontier landscape.  The music starts softly, works itself into a moderate frenzy, then spends the rest of its time calming itself back down.  The solo quartet refuses to play along, however, and emerges to perform a kind of resigned cadenza.\r\n\r\nThe title of the third movement\u0097{Louis Armstrong, in Heaven, Performs a Funeral March for Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti}\u0097pretty much says it all.  (For those of you who don\u0092t know, Armstrong was the first great jazz soloist, while Ligeti was the last great avant-garde composer\u0097a master of atmospheric dissonance who managed to make atonality sound good.  He died in June, while I was working on the piece.)  It is a New Orleans-style funeral march, of course, but it has been infected with some Ligeti-esque elements: glissandos, tone-clusters, and limping, off-kilter folksiness.  I will be happy if this movement is as fun to play (and to listen to) as it was to write!\r\n\r\nDmitri Tymoczko - 2006", "composer": 90, "title": "Power Chords - for string quartet and orchestra"}}, {"pk": 139, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "{Completed in June 1945, the Horn Concerto is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, timpani, strings and solo horn.}\r\n\r\nSir Malcolm Arnold was born in Northampton in 1921.

During a stay in this beautiful location I was taken by my friends to visit a deserted village in ruins. It actually looked about 200 years old but in actual fact was originally a commune of hippies during the '60s. During this experience I took my manuscript paper to this village and superimposed my experience over the song \"Black Dog.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n[Going to California]\r\n\r\nHave checked in to the Magic Hotel.  Pacific/Hawaiian glissando\u0092s, grilled Mahi-Mahi with a bottle of Robert Mondavi Fume Blanc.  Pink California grapefruits, Anaheim peppers, Hollywood stars, bars and dreams.\r\n\r\nThrough Silicon Valley at 100 mph, then we find ourselves in Olivera St. with the Muoz family.  Quesadilla, Bohemia beer, lashings of Cholulla hot sauce and a sprinkling of Mexican trumpets in 3rds.  Optimism, opportunity, finale, then silence.\r\n\r\nFlute and strings describe my sadness at the reintroduction of the death penalty in California.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Daughter of England] ({Sophia})\r\n\r\nI wrote the entirety of the score in the three days directly after the shocking announcement that HRH Dinana, Princess of Wales, had been killed in a car accident in Paris. The news profoundly affected me on many different levels. She was the first member of the Royal Family who actively reached out to the ordinary people of Great Britain. The genuine outpouring of grief affected everyone. Then there ws another connection, namely that her family (the Shand-Kydde family) took pity on me while I was studying orchestration and kindly provided me with a beautiful house in Nottinghill Gate (36 Portabello Road) where I could study rent-free. \r\nIn context to the libretto, I wanted to emphasise Princess Diana's legacy of her charitable works. She went out and kissed and embraced AIDS patients and landmine casualties, she was inspired by Mother Theresa and drew attention to the plight of the homeless, reinforced by her numerous charitable foundations. Thus I have tried to distill the very best of her into my text. \r\nOne of the more obscure factors I took into consideration with the libretto was Diana's remarkable geneology, which can be traced back to the dawn of civilisation. Once I discovered that the Princess of Wales was of Stuart decent, I consulted the world-renowned geneologist Sir Laurence Gardner, who is the official Jacobite histographer attache\u00e9d to the Royal House of Stuart and President of the European Council of Princess, to enlighten me. I was surprised to discover Diana's line could be traced back to the early French King Dagobert II, whose subsequent lineage is traced to the Holy Land and Sumer. Thus I list her entire family tree on the female side in chronological order. In the latter part of the work I wanted to crystallise her compassionate deeds in order to merge her immortal image with her acts of kindness, represented by the repitition of the Greek word 'Sophia', which simply means 'wisdom'. \r\nThe score was on my shelf gathering dust for almost a decade, as it was never my intention to capitalise or exploit her memory in any form. The work premiered by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra the Royal Albert Hall May 2006 to standing ovation. However, this was the shortened version until tonight.\r\n \r\n\r\n[The Battle of Evermore] ({Belfast})\r\n\r\nIrish pipes represent the emerald green, piccolo symbolizes the orange.  Des Copeland, who introduced me to the music of Sean O\u0092Reda, passed away the night we recorded this.  He is now having a drink with Terry Cox and they are both taking the piss out of me!  White pudding for breakfast before leaving the war zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[When the Levee Breaks] ({Will Work For Food})\r\n\r\nI am looking out of a Chicago caf\u00e9 at an African-American holding a placard with the words I WILL WORK FOR FOOD.  Score in the manner of a spiritual.  Re-work the second development section to capture a psychotic Baptist vibe in semi-quavers (160 BPM).  The pain of struggle obliterated by revelation.  Refer to Martin Luther King\u0092s famous oratory.  How do we honor Bonham with orchestral percussion?  Faith!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Whole Lotta Love] ({Grozny})\r\n\r\nWhen I approached the arrangement of \"Whole Lotta Love,\" I decided not to take the obvious route. Before I commenced the work, I was studying the conflict in Chechnya and was profoundly moved. Again I superimposed my reflections over the original riff of \"Whole Lotta Love.\" I let my inspiration run wild and in the end finished a fourteen-minute epic that was never used on the original record, hence this exciting premiere tonight.\r\n \r\n\r\n[All Of My Love] ({In the Library at Windsor})\r\n\r\nIn the library at Windsor.  Memories of Sally Ann and Terry (who knew of my arcane curiosity).  I know of only one library that would exceed in magnificence to the collection at Windsor and this would be found in the Vatican.  After this experience I realized that knowledge pales in significance to the heart.  The dead live by love.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Friends]\r\n\r\nWe are in the regency town of Cheltenham, the birth place of Gustav Holst, Brian Jones and the Black Jester.  Its relevance to Friends\u009d becomes apparent when I realized that John Paul Jones appears to have adapted the original mellotron/string part from Mars in Holst\u0092s Planet Suite.  Everything turns full circle as one of the original composers suddenly becomes the arranger, thus we hand this arrangement (with full honors) back to the spirit of Holst on a platter.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Holst was a member of the Institute of Oriental Studies in London so all roads lead to home.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Stairway to Heaven] ({Sketch in NZ feeling homesick})\r\n\r\nInitially I was reluctant to score this piece as we all know it is perhaps the most covered song after Sinatra\u0092s My Way\u009d.  It wasn\u0092t until I actually listened to all the symphonic abortions of this sacred Celtic anthem that I felt a sense of authority to complete the mother of all Stairways.  That profound themes such as death and enlightenment could be perfectly expressed in one song through both lyric and melody, is testament to the genius of Robert Plant.  Check out the penultimate version.  No retro zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Kashmir]\r\nThe time is 4:00 a.m. and we are in Cairo, Egypt at the end of Haj.  Cattle line the street waiting slaughter.  Later today I work at the Hany Mehanna studio but not before everyone is rounded up to witness sunrise at the Great Pyramid on horseback (which is the introduction to this work).\r\n\r\nWe are here bathing in the shimmering light.  One can almost see the praises rising, the triumph of spirit over matter, the mastery of anti-gravity, a universe expressed in pure mathematics, sacred geometry and masonry that defies all rationality.\r\n\r\nThe time is now 10,700 BC.  Brother Youth takes our experience into 3D.  Our pilgrimage has begun.  Arabic percussion, transmute Bonham into orchestral percussion.

This cello concerto employs a four-note theme that functions as the cornerstone of the first movement\u0092s unrelenting development. The opening movement of the concerto is one of his most celebrated creations, one that makes use of not only the instrumental color of the accompanying woodwinds but also the prominently featured solo parts for clarinet and horn. Shostakovich, in his orchestration, included only one brass instrument: one horn, to which he assigned a significant role in segments of the piece. In some passages of the first movement, the horn appears to be stoking the thematic fire stated by the cello; while during others it is the cello's companion, promptly reaffirming its energy. The repetitive crying themes presented by the cello are reminders of Stalin\u0092s authoritative vice grip on his people.

Inspired by fantasy fiction by Arthur Conan Doyle (creator of Sherlock Holmes) and Edgar Rice Burroughs (creator of Tarzan), King Kong was one of the first blockbuster films of the sound era in films (synchronized sound having come to Hollywood less than ten years earlier). The giant ape has been such a popular character that there have not only been sequels, but two complete remakes (one in 1976, directed by John Guillermin, and another in 2005, directed by Peter Jackson), as well as appearances in Japanese sci-fi cinema (beginning with King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)). The score for the original King Kong was written by arguably the first important film composer of the sound era, Max Steiner. A child prodigy as a composer\u0097he had lessons from Brahms and Mahler\u0097Steiner first made a name for himself as a composer of operetta. His first work in Hollywood was for the film Rio Rita (1929). His ability to integrate his music with the action on screen brought him acclaim as a composer, especially in the early 1930s, when composers and studios alike were still trying to figure out exactly what role music should play in the movies. He would go on to score literally hundreds of films; a sampling of his scores include those for The Informer (1936), Dark Victory (1939), Gone With the Wind (1939),  Now, Voyager (1942), Casablanca (1942), The Big Sleep (1946), Life With Father (1947), and The Caine Mutiny (1954).\r\n\r\nDaniel Goldmark, 2008", "composer": 103, "title": "King Kong, 1933"}}, {"pk": 162, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "Spider-Man (2002)\r\nWhile director Sam Raimi\u0092s franchise of Spider-Man films began in 2002, the character of Spider-Man is almost a half-century old.

Bernard Herrmann's film scores, in particluar those written after the mid-1950's, are characterized by great economy of means. Ostinato patterns, austerely simple harmonic structures and unorthodox orchestration are notable features of his style. He chose to score PSYCHO for strings alone in an attempt to reflect in music the \"Black-and White\" image of the film.\r\n\r\nHerrmann compiled PSYCHO Suite from the manuscript of the film score. No recomposition was done; the material employed in the suite comes directly from the film score. He selected 11 of the 40 pieces he wrote for the film, grouping them into three sections.\r\n\r\nThe first section comes from the first half of the film, where marion Crane (Janet Leigh) absconds with $40,000 from her job at a bank. She loses her way in a rainstorm and comes to rest at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). The second section describes Marions murder by Norman's mother, and Norman's attmept to protect his mother by burying the body in the swamp behind the motel. The third section describes the murder of Arbogast (Martin Baksam), a private detective hired to find Marion, and the denouement, where norman is revealed as a homicidal psychopath.\r\n\r\nUnknown, 1960\r\n\r\nPyscho (1960)\r\nThe music for the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock\u0092s film Psycho (1960) usually tops people\u0092s list of the scariest music ever written. Few people know that Hitchcock actually considered running the scene with no music whatsoever. Fortunately for us, the director took the advice of his composer, Bernard Herrmann, with whom he had already collaborated on the scores for three films, including Vertigo (1958). While most films in Hollywood were being produced in color by 1960, Hitchcock made the decision to shoot in black and white for several reasons (it was more economical, the gore would be less intense, and it made the film stand out starkly against other films being produced at the time). Herrmann therefore chose to restrain his own color palette as a composer by using only a string orchestra for the entire score. Rather than limiting Herrmann\u0092s ability to write, the string-only approach actually forced the composer to explore all the possibilities the string orchestra could offer him; the resulting score goes through every emotion imaginable, including the rhythmic drive of the opening titles, the terrifying screeches of the shower scene, and the sweetly suspenseful melody of the closing scene.\r\n\r\nDaniel Goldmark, 2008", "composer": 105, "title": "PSYCHO"}}, {"pk": 166, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "[The Royal Tenenbaums]\r\n\r\n[111 Archer Avenue] \r\nWes Andersons movies can be a little bit like a high school play turned into a movie and this was sort of the magical puff of theatrical smoke at the beginning of the film.

He is best known for his opera Nixon in China (1985\u009687), recounting Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. His choral piece On the Transmigration of Souls (2002), commemorating the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks, won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2003. Adams is usually categorized as minimalist or post-minimalist. While he employs minimalist techniques, such as repeating patterns, he is not a strict follower of the movement. Adams was born a generation after Steve Reich and Philip Glass, and his writing is more developmental and directionalized, containing climaxes and other elements of Romanticism.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman Dances was an \"out-take\" of Act III of Nixon in China. Neither an \"excerpt\" nor a \"fantasy on themes from,\" it was in fact a kind of warmup for embraking on the creation of the full opera. At the time, 1985, I was obliged to fulfill a long-delayed commission for the Milwaukee Symphony, but having already seen the scenario to Act III of Nixon in China, I couldn\u0092t wait to begin work on that piece. So The Chairman Dances began as a \"foxtrot\" for Chairman Mao and his bride, Chiang Ch\u0092ing, the fabled \"Madame Mao,\" firebrand, revolutionary executioner, architect of China\u0092s calamitous Cultural Revolution, and (a fact not universally realized) a former Shanghai movie actress. In the surreal final scene of the opera, she interrupts the tired formalities of a state banquet, disrupts the slow moving protocol and invites the Chairman, who is present only as a gigantic forty-foot portrait on the wall, to \"come down, old man, and dance.\" The music takes full cognizance of her past as a movie actress. Themes, sometimes slinky and sentimental, at other times bravura and bounding, ride above in bustling fabric of energized motives. Some of these themes make a dreamy reappearance in Act III of the actual opera, en revenant, as both the Nixons and Maos reminisce over their distant pasts. A scenario by Peter Sellars and Alice Goodman, somewhat altered from the final one in Nixon in China, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Chiang Ch\u0092ing, a.k.a. Madame Mao, has gate crashed the Presidential Banquet. She is first seen standing where she is most in the way of the waiters. After a few minutes, she brings out a box of paper lanterns and hangs them around the hall, then strips down to a cheongsam, skin-tight from neck to ankle and slit up the hip.

The possibility of writing a piece for that sort of ensemble intrigued me, especially the prospect of placing it within an orchestral texture, and the invitation from Liza seemed to be the perfect opportunity to explore this idea.

Psyche, a beautiful mortal, is, in fact, too beautiful for the goddess Aphrodite, who sends her son Eros to punish her. Instead, Eros falls in love with Psyche and takes her away to his palace where she, although blindfolded (for mortals aren\u0092t allowed to see gods), falls in love with him.  Mislead by her jealous sisters, Psyche makes the mistake of not trusting her young loving heart and tries to see Eros, taking off her blindfold as she leans over him with a candle light. The dripping wax accidentally burns his skin and awakes him \u0096 the wound hurts him less than her betrayal, and in horrible pain, he flees. Aphrodite punishes this transgression by sending Psyche to hell, where she is forced to tortuous tasks. Against all odds, Eros and Psyche hold their love true, and as he forgives her, and she is patient and brave and conquers all the tasks, Zeus intervenes and helps the lovers find each other, as he gives Psyche a potion that will make her immortal. Unlike most mythological stories of love versus fear, it is love that prevails here. This love is represented in the piece by the pitch Ab (pitch class 8), the sum of both Eros (pitch B, 11) and Psyche (pitch A, 9). The pitches of fear, a tritone away from the pitches of love, are represented by D, Eb and F, which we hear throughout the work in the form of almost distant, yet very present high chords that fill the air with a sense of uneasiness. These six pitches battle for supremacy throughout the entire work. In the final bars of the piece, we hear both Eros and Psyche\u0092s themes together for the first and only time in the piece, sustained by Ab, the pitch of love, which ends the piece, quietly and almost unresolved: for passion and love, even after conquering fear, remains subject to the uncertainties of life.

The face-on galaxy (A) has many young blue star clusters while the twisted edge-on galaxy (B) is wrapped in the bridging material and surrounded by a magical ring of light. This image struck me with a keen emotion, and so when the opportunity came along for me to write a new work for the Contemporary Youth Orchestra, I decided this would be my subject.\r\n~Monica Houghton", "composer": 70, "title": "Arp 87"}}, {"pk": 269, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "Dmitri Shostakovich's [String Quartet No. 8 in C minor (Op. 110)] was written in three days (July 12\u009614, 1960). It was premiered that year in Leningrad by the Beethoven Quartet.\r\n\r\nThe piece was written shortly after two traumatic events: the composer's diagnosis with polio, and his joining the Communist Party reluctantly. According to the score, it is dedicated \"to the victims of fascism and war\"; his son, Maxim, interprets this as a reference to the victims of all totalitarianism, while his daughter Galina says that he dedicated it to himself, and that the published dedication was imposed by the Russian authorities. Shostakovich's friend, Lev Lebedinsky, said that Shostakovich thought of the work as his epitaph and that he planned to commit suicide around this time. The work was written in Dresden, where Shostakovich was to write music for the film Five Days, Five Nights, a joint project by Soviet and East German filmmakers about Bombing of Dresden in World War II. The quartet, extremely compact and focused, is in five interconnected movements and lasts twenty minutes:\r\nLargo; Allegro molto; Allegretto; Largo; Largo\r\n\r\nThe first movement opens with the DSCH motif which was Shostakovich's musical signature. This slow, extremely sad theme can also be heard in his Cello Concerto No. 1, Symphony No. 10, Violin Concerto No. 1, Symphony No. 15, and Piano Sonata No. 2. The motif is used in every movement of this quartet, and is the basis of the faster theme of the third movement.\r\nThe work is filled with quotes of other pieces by Shostakovich: the first movement quotes his Symphony No. 1 and Symphony No. 5; the second movement uses a Jewish theme first used by Shostakovich in his Piano Trio No. 2; the third movement quotes the Cello Concerto No. 1; and the fourth movement quotes the 19th century revolutionary song \"Tormented by Grievous Bondage\" and the aria \"Seryozha, my love\" from Shostakovich's opera, Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District.\r\n~ Wikipedia", "composer": 78, "title": "String Quartet No. 8"}}, {"pk": 270, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "William Alwyn (1905-1985) was born in Northampton, England. After showing great promise on the flute and piccolo, he entered the Royal Academy of Music in London to study flute performance and composition. He had long and distinguished careers in both fields, serving as a flautist in the London Symphony Orchestra for a time and serving as the professor of composition at the Royal Academy from 1926-1955. Although remembered mostly for his large and varied output of orchestral works, chamber works, and concerti for several individual and groups of instruments, he also wrote over 200 film scores, including Odd Man Out, Fires Were Started, The Fallen Idol, and Crimson Pirate. In addition to composing and performing, he was also a prolific painter, sculptor, and poet. He died in Southwold, Suffolk.\r\nEvelyn Rothwell premiered Concerto for Oboe, Strings and Harp on August 12th, 1949. She was the future wife of conductor John Barbirolli, who later championed many of Alwyn's symphonic works. The Concerto is in two movements, the first being a slow pastorale; the second, a dance-like movement reminiscent of the countryside Alwyn had to desert during World War II. The second movement opens with a three-against-two motion in the strings, a rhythmic pattern seen throughout the work, leading to the solo oboe declaring one of the short themes Alwyn frequently returns to and develops throughout the first half of the movement. After several exchanges between the solo oboe and the strings, the work gradually slows down through the reintroduction of material from the first movement, growing to a climatic fanfare-like finish.\r\n\r\n`Joshua Lauretig, soloist.", "composer": 158, "title": "Concerto for Oboe, String Orchestra and Harp"}}, {"pk": 271, "model": "repertoire.song", "fields": {"description": "[PROJECT Trio] is a passionate, high-energy chamber music ensemble comprised of three virtuosic composer/performers from Brooklyn, NY.

Flutist Carol Wincenc had known Lukas Foss since her youth in the 1960\u0092s, when he was music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic. When she asked him to write a flute concerto for her in 1985, he was faced with the problem confronted by every composer in this genre: how to create orchestral texture that would not overwhelm the solo instrument. Recalling that the flute \u0091was a favorite instrument in the Renaissance and baroque eras\u0085\u0092, he sought the sound he wanted in early music. The work, Foss said, is \u0093an homage to something I love, a handshake across the centuries.\u0094 He completed the Renaissance Concerto on March 17, 1986.\r\nIn addition to the solo flute, this work calls for four woodwinds, four brass instruments, harp, percussion and strings \u0096 an ensemble that can range in size from 19-62 instruments, depending on the number of strings. The concerto is in four movements. \r\n\r\nIV. Jouissance.  The incisive opening canon comes from Melville\u0092s 1612 madrigal \u0091Musing\u0092.

There is a cadenza for flute and drum, and when the music dwindles to pianissimo tapping of flute keys and drum, the light changes, and the ghosts of Galilei, Gesualdo, and Peri briefly appear one by one. An insistent rhythm lingers as the ghostly mood returns amid eerie string glissandos. The soloist, who has been commenting volubly on all this, now does a disappearing act, walking offstage as the flute dwindles to a breathy whisper and finally to mere key-clicks.

One such phrase was \"Liquid Melancholy\" - when referring to sleep-inducing medication. I knew right then that if I ever had the opportunity to use that as a title, I would jump on it.\r\n\r\nThat opportunity came just a few months later, when Liza Grossman, director of the Contemporary Youth Orchestra in Cleveland, asked to commission me to write a new clarinet concerto for Daniel Gilbert. A consortium of three ensembles was quickly formed, including Liza/CYO, the Midwest Young Artists (John Bruce Yeh, soloist, and Allan Dennis, conductor) and the Portland Youth Philharmonic (David Shiffrin, soloist and David Hattner, conductor). This project excited me on multiple levels: I had never written a major work for the clarinet, and everyone for whom I was writing was terrific friends and wonderful musicians (Liza Grossman, David Hattner and I going back to high school days at the Interlochen Arts Academy).\r\n\r\nI've always been fascinated by the clarinet's ability to play such smooth and fluid lines, at all dynamic levels. This \"liquidity\" is something I wanted to highlight in this concerto. This is most evident in the 1st movement, when the clarinet is set against angular lines, first introduced by the solo cello. For the melancholy aspect, I wanted to write some searching music: some deeply personal and intimate music, a chance for the soloist and audience to relate and reflect upon what I put out there. This is the 2nd movement. The third and fourth movements are played without break - an accompanied cadenza followed by a wispy and light final scherzo.\r\n\r\nThe concerto is roughly 16 minutes, and is scored for Solo Clarinet + 2 Flutes, Piccolo, 2 Oboes, English Horn, 2 Bb Clarinets, Bass Clarinet, 2 Bassoons 4 Horns, 2 C Trumpets, 2 Trombones, Bass Trombone, Tuba, Timpani, 4 percussionists, Harp and Strings.\r\n\r\nIt is with great pleasure that I dedicate this work to the consortium of three orchestras/soloists for their belief in commissioning new music, and to Liza Grossman and Daniel Gilbert, for initiating the idea and premiering the work.\r\n~ James M.
